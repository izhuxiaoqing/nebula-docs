It uses a complete algorithm tool to perform graph computing on the data in the Nebula Graph database by submitting a Spark task. You can also programmatically use the algorithm under the lib repository to perform graph computing on DataFrame. Prerequisites \u00b6 Before using the Nebula Algorithm, users need to confirm the following information: The Nebula Graph services have been deployed and started. For details, see Nebula Installation . The Spark version is 2.4.x. The Scala version is 2.11. (Optional) If users need to clone, compile, and package the latest Algorithm in Github, install Maven . Limitations \u00b6 The data of the vertex ID must be an integer. That is, the vertex ID can be INT or String, but the data itself is an integer. For non-integer String data, it is recommended to use the algorithm interface. You can use the dense_rank function of SparkSQL to encode the data as the Long type instead of the String type. Graph computing outputs vertex datasets, and the algorithm results are stored in DataFrames as the properties of vertices. You can do further operations such as statistics and filtering according to your business requirements. Supported algorithms \u00b6 The graph computing algorithms supported by Nebula Algorithm are as follows. Algorithm Description Scenario PageRank The rank of pages Web page ranking, key node mining Louvain Community discovery Community mining, hierarchical clustering KCore K core Community discovery, financial risk control LabelPropagation Label propagation Information spreading, advertising, and community discovery ConnectedComponent Connected component Community discovery, island discovery StronglyConnectedComponent Strongly connected component Community discovery ShortestPath The shortest path Path planning, network planning TriangleCount Triangle counting Network structure analysis GraphTriangleCount Graph triangle counting Network structure and tightness analysis BetweennessCentrality Intermediate centrality Key node mining, node influence computing DegreeStatic Degree of statistical Graph structure analysis Implementation methods \u00b6 Nebula Algorithm implements the graph calculating as follows: Read the graph data of DataFrame from the Nebula Graph database using the Nebula Spark Connector. Transform the graph data of DataFrame to the GraphX graph. Use graph algorithms provided by GraphX (such as PageRank) or self-implemented algorithms (such as Louvain). For detailed implementation methods, see Scala file . Get Nebula Algorithm \u00b6 Compile and package \u00b6 Clone the repository nebula-algorithm . $ git clone -b v2.5 https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-algorithm.git Enter the directory nebula-algorithm . $ cd nebula-algorithm Compile and package. $ mvn clean package -Dgpg.skip -Dmaven.javadoc.skip = true -Dmaven.test.skip = true After the compilation, a similar file nebula-algorithm-2.5.1.jar is generated in the directory nebula-algorithm/target . Download maven from the remote repository \u00b6 Download address How to use \u00b6 Use algorithm interface (recommended) \u00b6 The lib repository provides 10 common graph algorithms. Add dependencies to the file pom.xml . <dependency> <groupId>com.vesoft</groupId> <artifactId>nebula-algorithm</artifactId> <version>2.5.1</version> </dependency> Use the algorithm (take PageRank as an example) by filling in parameters. For more algorithms, see Test cases ). Note By default, the DataFrame that executes the algorithm sets the first column as the starting vertex, the second column as the destination vertex, and the third column as the edge weights (not the rank in the Nebula Graph). val prConfig = new PRConfig ( 5 , 1 .0 ) val louvainResult = PageRankAlgo.apply ( spark, data, prConfig, false ) Submit the algorithm package directly \u00b6 Note There are limitations to use sealed packages. For example, when sinking a repository into Nebula Graph, the property name of the tag created in the sunk graph space must match the preset name in the code. The first method is recommended if the user has development skills.

It is capable of hosting graphs with hundreds of billions of vertices and trillions of edges, and serving queries with millisecond-latency. What is a graph database \u00b6 A graph database, such as Nebula Graph, is a database that specializes in storing vast graph networks and retrieving information from them. It efficiently stores data as vertices (nodes) and edges (relationships) in labeled property graphs. Properties can be attached to both vertices and edges. Each vertex can have one or multiple tags (labels). Graph databases are well suited for storing most kinds of data models abstracted from reality. Things are connected in almost all fields in the world. Modeling systems like relational databases extract the relationships between entities and squeeze them into table columns alone, with their types and properties stored in other columns or even other tables.

This topic describes the Nebula Graph data model and provides suggestions for data modeling with Nebula Graph. Data structures \u00b6 Nebula Graph data model uses six data structures to store data. They are graph spaces, vertices, edges, tags, edge types and properties. Graph spaces : Graph spaces are used to isolate data from different teams or programs. Data stored in different graph spaces are securely isolated. Storage replications, privileges, and partitions can be assigned. Vertices : Vertices are used to store entities. In Nebula Graph, vertices are identified with vertex identifiers (i.e. VID ). The VID must be unique in the same graph space. VID should be int64, or fixed_string(N). A vertex must have at least one tag or multiple tags. Edges : Edges are used to connect vertices. An edge is a connection or behavior between two vertices. There can be multiple edges between two vertices. Edges are directed. -> identifies the directions of edges. Edges can be traversed in either direction. An edge is identified uniquely with a source vertex, an edge type, a rank value, and a destination vertex. Edges have no EID. An edge must have one and only one edge type. The rank value is an immutable user-assigned 64-bit signed integer. It identifies the edges with the same edge type between two vertices. Edges are sorted by their rank values. The edge with the greatest rank value is listed first. The default rank value is zero. Tags : Tags are used to categorize vertices. Vertices that have the same tag share the same definition of properties. Edge types : Edge types are used to categorize edges. Edges that have the same edge type share the same definition of properties. Properties : Properties are key-value pairs. Both vertices and edges are containers for properties. Note Tag and Edge type are similar to the vertex table and edge table in the relational databases. Directed property graph \u00b6 Nebula Graph stores data in directed property graphs. A directed property graph has a set of vertices connected by directed edges. Both vertices and edges can have properties. A directed property graph is represented as: G = < V, E, P V , P E > V is a set of vertices. E is a set of directed edges. P V is the property of vertices. P E is the property of edges. The following table is an example of the structure of the basketball player dataset. We have two types of vertices, that is player and team , and two types of edges, that is serve and follow . Element Name Property name (Data type) Description Tag player name (string) age (int) Represents players in the team. Tag team name (string) Represents the teams. Edge type serve start_year (int) end_year (int) Represents actions taken by players in the team. An action links a player with a team, and the direction is from a player to a team. Edge type follow degree (int) Represents actions taken by players in the team. An action links a player with another player, and the direction is from one player to the other player. Note Nebula Graph supports only directed edges. Compatibility Nebula Graph master allows dangling edges. Therefore, when adding or deleting, you need to ensure the corresponding source vertex and destination vertex of an edge exist. For details, see INSERT VERTEX , DELETE VERTEX , INSERT EDGE , and DELETE EDGE . The MERGE statement in openCypher is not supported.","title":"Data model"},{"location":"1.introduction/2.data-model/#data_modeling","text":"A data model is a model that organizes data and specifies how they are related to one another.

The rank value is an immutable user-assigned 64-bit signed integer. It identifies the edges with the same edge type between two vertices. Edges are sorted by their rank values. The edge with the greatest rank value is listed first. The default rank value is zero. Tags : Tags are used to categorize vertices. Vertices that have the same tag share the same definition of properties. Edge types : Edge types are used to categorize edges. Edges that have the same edge type share the same definition of properties. Properties : Properties are key-value pairs. Both vertices and edges are containers for properties. Note Tag and Edge type are similar to the vertex table and edge table in the relational databases.","title":"Data structures"},{"location":"1.introduction/2.data-model/#directed_property_graph","text":"Nebula Graph stores data in directed property graphs. A directed property graph has a set of vertices connected by directed edges. Both vertices and edges can have properties. A directed property graph is represented as: G = < V, E, P V , P E > V is a set of vertices. E is a set of directed edges. P V is the property of vertices. P E is the property of edges. The following table is an example of the structure of the basketball player dataset. We have two types of vertices, that is player and team , and two types of edges, that is serve and follow . Element Name Property name (Data type) Description Tag player name (string) age (int) Represents players in the team. Tag team name (string) Represents the teams. Edge type serve start_year (int) end_year (int) Represents actions taken by players in the team. An action links a player with a team, and the direction is from a player to a team. Edge type follow degree (int) Represents actions taken by players in the team. An action links a player with another player, and the direction is from one player to the other player. Note Nebula Graph supports only directed edges. Compatibility Nebula Graph master allows dangling edges. Therefore, when adding or deleting, you need to ensure the corresponding source vertex and destination vertex of an edge exist.

Features \u00b6 The data types of VIDs are restricted to FIXED_STRING(<N>) or INT64 ; a graph space can only select one VID type. A VID in a graph space is unique. It functions just as a primary key in a relational database. VIDs in different graph spaces are independent. The VID generation method must be set by users, because Nebula Graph does not provide auto increasing ID, or UUID. Vertices with the same VID will be identified as the same one. For example: A VID is the unique identifier of an entity, like a person's ID card number. A tag means the type of an entity, such as driver, and boss. Different tags define two groups of different properties, such as driving license number, driving age, order amount, order taking alt, and job number, payroll, debt ceiling, business phone number. When two INSERT statements (neither uses a parameter of IF NOT EXISTS ) with the same VID and tag are operated at the same time, the latter INSERT will overwrite the former. When two INSERT statements with the same VID but different tags, like TAG A and TAG B , are operated at the same time, the operation of Tag A will not affect Tag B . VIDs will usually be indexed and stored into memory (in the way of LSM-tree). Thus, direct access to VIDs enjoys peak performance. VID Operation \u00b6 Nebula Graph 1.x only supports INT64 while Nebula Graph 2.x supports INT64 and FIXED_STRING(<N>) . In CREATE SPACE , VID types can be set via vid_type . id() function can be used to specify or locate a VID. LOOKUP or MATCH statements can be used to find a VID via property index. Direct access to vertices statements via VIDs enjoys peak performance, such as DELETE xxx WHERE id(xxx) == \"player100\" or GO FROM \"player100\" . Finding VIDs via properties and then operating the graph will cause poor performance, such as LOOKUP | GO FROM $-.ids , which will run both LOOKUP and | one more time. VID Generation \u00b6 VIDs can be generated via applications. Here are some tips: (Optimal) Directly take a unique primary key or property as a VID. Property access depends on the VID. Generate a VID via a unique combination of properties. Property access depends on property index. Generate a VID via algorithms like snowflake. Property access depends on property index. If short primary keys greatly outnumber long primary keys, do not enlarge the N of FIXED_STRING(<N>) too much. Otherwise, it will occupy a lot of memory and hard disks, and slow down performance. Generate VIDs via BASE64, MD5, hash by encoding and splicing. If you generate inte64 VID via hash, the probability of collision is about 1/10 when there are 1 billion vertices. The number of edges has no concern with the probability of collision. Define and modify the data type of VIDs \u00b6 The data type of VIDs must be defined when you create the graph space . Once defined, it cannot be modified. Query start vid and global scan \u00b6 In most cases, the execution plan of query statements in Nebula Graph ( MATCH , GO , and LOOKUP ) must query the start vid in a certain way. There are only two ways to locate start vid : For example, GO FROM \"player100\" OVER explicitly indicates in the statement that start vid is \"player100\". For example, LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.name == \"Tony Parker\" or MATCH (v:player {name:\"Tony Parker\"}) locates start vid by the index of the property player.name .

It has four submodules: Parser, Validator, Planner, and Executor. This topic will describe Graph Service accordingly. The architecture of Graph Service \u00b6 After a query is sent to Graph Service, it will be processed by the following four submodules: Parser : Performs lexical analysis and syntax analysis. Validator : Validates the statements. Planner : Generates and optimizes the execution plans. Executor : Executes the operators. Parser \u00b6 After receiving a request, the statements will be parsed by the Parser composed of Flex (lexical analysis tool) and Bison (syntax analysis tool), and its corresponding AST will be generated. Statements will be directly intercepted in this stage because of its invalid syntax. For example, the structure of the AST of GO FROM \"Tim\" OVER like WHERE properties(edge).likeness > 8.0 YIELD dst(edge) is shown in the following picture. Validator \u00b6 Validator performs a series of validations on the AST. It mainly works on these tasks: Validating metadata Validator will validate whether the metadata is correct or not. When parsing the OVER , WHERE , and YIELD clauses, Validator looks up the Schema and verifies whether the edge type and tag data exist or not. For an INSERT statement, Validator verifies whether the types of the inserted data are the same as the ones defined in the Schema. Validating contextual reference Validator will verify whether the cited variable exists or not, or whether the cited property is variable or not. For composite statements, like $var = GO FROM \"Tim\" OVER like YIELD dst(edge) AS ID; GO FROM $var.ID OVER serve YIELD dst(edge) , Validator verifies first to see if var is defined, and then to check if the ID property is attached to the var variable. Validating type inference Validator infers what type the result of an expression is and verifies the type against the specified clause. For example, the WHERE clause requires the result to be a bool value, a NULL value, or empty . Validating the information of * Validator needs to verify all the Schema that involves * when verifying the clause if there is a * in the statement. Take a statement like GO FROM \"Tim\" OVER * YIELD dst(edge), properties(edge).likeness, dst(edge) as an example. When verifying the OVER clause, Validator needs to verify all the edge types. If the edge type includes like and serve , the statement would be GO FROM \"Tim\" OVER like,serve YIELD dst(edge), properties(edge).likeness, dst(edge) . Validating input and output Validator will check the consistency of the clauses before and after the | . In the statement GO FROM \"Tim\" OVER like YIELD dst(edge) AS ID | GO FROM $-.ID OVER serve YIELD dst(edge) , Validator will verify whether $-.ID is defined in the clause before the | . When the validation succeeds, an execution plan will be generated. Its data structure will be stored in the src/planner directory. Planner \u00b6 In the nebula-graphd.conf file, when enable_optimizer is set to be false , Planner will not optimize the execution plans generated by Validator. It will be executed by Executor directly. In the nebula-graphd.conf file, when enable_optimizer is set to be true , Planner will optimize the execution plans generated by Validator. The structure is as follows. Before optimization In the execution plan on the right side of the preceding picture, each node directly depends on other nodes. For example, the root node Project depends on the Filter node, the Filter node depends on the GetNeighbor node, and so on, up to the leaf node Start . Then the execution plan is (not truly) executed. During this stage, every node has its input and output variables, which are stored in a hash table. The execution plan is not truly executed, so the value of each key in the associated hash table is empty (except for the Start node, where the input variables hold the starting data), and the hash table is defined in src/context/ExecutionContext.cpp under the nebula-graph repository. For example, if the hash table is named as ResultMap when creating the Filter node, users can determine that the node takes data from ResultMap[\"GN1\"] , then puts the result into ResultMap[\"Filter2\"] , and so on. All these work as the input and output of each node. Process of optimization The optimization rules that Planner has implemented so far are considered RBO (Rule-Based Optimization), namely the pre-defined optimization rules. The CBO (Cost-Based Optimization) feature is under development. The optimized code is in the src/optimizer/ directory under the nebula-graph repository. RBO is a \u201cbottom-up\u201d exploration process. For each rule, the root node of the execution plan (in this case, the Project node) is the entry point, and step by step along with the node dependencies, it reaches the node at the bottom to see if it matches the rule. As shown in the preceding figure, when the Filter node is explored, it is found that its children node is GetNeighbors , which matches successfully with the pre-defined rules, so a transformation is initiated to integrate the Filter node into the GetNeighbors node, the Filter node is removed, and then the process continues to the next rule. Therefore, when the GetNeighbor operator calls interfaces of the Storage layer to get the neighboring edges of a vertex during the execution stage, the Storage layer will directly filter out the unqualified edges internally. Such optimization greatly reduces the amount of data transfer, which is commonly known as filter pushdown. Note Nebula Graph master will not run optimization by default. Executor \u00b6 The Executor module consists of Scheduler and Executor. The Scheduler generates the corresponding execution operators against the execution plan, starting from the leaf nodes and ending at the root node. The structure is as follows. Each node of the execution plan has one execution operator node, whose input and output have been determined in the execution plan. Each operator only needs to get the values for the input variables, compute them, and finally put the results into the corresponding output variables. Therefore, it is only necessary to execute step by step from Start , and the result of the last operator is returned to the user as the final result. Source code hierarchy \u00b6 The source code hierarchy under the nebula-graph repository is as follows. | --src | --context //contexts for validation and execution | --daemons | --executor //execution operators | --mock | --optimizer //optimization rules | --parser //lexical analysis and syntax analysis | --planner //structure of the execution plans | --scheduler //scheduler | --service | --util //basic components | --validator //validation of the statements | --visitor","title":"Graph Service"},{"location":"1.introduction/3.nebula-graph-architecture/3.graph-service/#graph_service","text":"Graph Service is used to process the query.

One is the Meta Service that stores the meta-related data. The other is the Storage Service that stores the data, which is run by the nebula-storaged process. This topic will describe the architecture of Storage Service. Advantages \u00b6 High performance (Customized built-in KVStore) Great scalability (Shared-nothing architecture, not rely on NAS/SAN-like devices) Strong consistency (Raft) High availability (Raft) Supports synchronizing with the third party systems, such as Elasticsearch . The architecture of Storage Service \u00b6 Storage Service is run by the nebula-storaged process. Users can deploy nebula-storaged processes on different occasions. For example, users can deploy 1 nebula-storaged process in a test environment and deploy 3 nebula-storaged processes in a production environment. All the nebula-storaged processes consist of a Raft-based cluster. There are three layers in the Storage Service: Storage interface The top layer is the storage interface. It defines a set of APIs that are related to the graph concepts. These API requests will be translated into a set of KV operations targeting the corresponding Partition . For example: getNeighbors : query the in-edge or out-edge of a set of vertices, return the edges and the corresponding properties, and support conditional filtering. insert vertex/edge : insert a vertex or edge and its properties. getProps : get the properties of a vertex or an edge. It is this layer that makes the Storage Service a real graph storage. Otherwise, it is just a KV storage. Consensus Below the storage interface is the consensus layer that implements Multi Group Raft , which ensures the strong consistency and high availability of the Storage Service. Store engine The bottom layer is the local storage engine library, providing operations like get , put , and scan on local disks. The related interfaces are stored in KVStore.h and KVEngine.h files. Users can develop their own local store plugins based on their needs. The following will describe some features of Storage Service based on the above architecture. KVStore \u00b6 Nebula Graph develops and customizes its built-in KVStore for the following reasons. It is a high-performance KVStore. It is provided as a (kv) library and can be easily developed for the filter pushdown purpose. As a strong-typed database, how to provide Schema during pushdown is the key to efficiency for Nebula Graph. It has strong data consistency. Therefore, Nebula Graph develops its own KVStore with RocksDB as the local storage engine. The advantages are as follows. For multiple local hard disks, Nebula Graph can make full use of its concurrent capacities through deploying multiple data directories. Meta Service manages all the Storage servers. All the partition distribution data and current machine status can be found in the meta service. Accordingly, users can execute a manual load balancing plan in meta service. Note Nebula Graph does not support auto load balancing because auto data transfer will affect online business. Nebula Graph provides its own WAL mode so one can customize the WAL. Each partition owns its WAL. One Nebula Graph KVStore cluster supports multiple graph spaces, and each graph space has its own partition number and replica copies. Different graph spaces are isolated physically from each other in the same cluster. Data storage formats \u00b6 Nebula Graph stores vertices and edges. Efficient property filtering is critical for a Graph Database. So, Nebula Graph uses keys to store vertices and edges, while uses values to store the related properties. Nebula Graph 2.0 has changed a lot over its releases. The following will introduce the old and new data storage formats and cover their differences. Vertex format Field Description Type One byte, used to indicate the key type. PartID Three bytes, used to indicate the sharding partition and to scan the partition data based on the prefix when re-balancing the partition. VertexID Used to indicate vertex ID. For an integer VertexID, it occupies eight bytes. However, for a string VertexID, it is changed to fixed_string of a fixed length which needs to be specified by users when they create the space. TagID Four bytes, used to indicate the tags that vertex relate with. Edge Format Field Description Type One byte, used to indicate the key type. PartID Three bytes, used to indicate the sharding partition. This field can be used to scan the partition data based on the prefix when re-balancing the partition. VertexID Used to indicate vertex ID. The former VID refers to source VID in out-edge and dest VID in in-edge, while the latter VID refers to dest VID in out-edge and source VID in in-edge. Edge Type Four bytes, used to indicate edge type. Greater than zero means out-edge, less than zero means in-edge. Rank Eight bytes, used to indicate multiple edges in one edge type. Users can set the field based on needs and store weight, such as transaction time and transaction number. PlaceHolder One byte. Reserved. Legacy version compatibility The differences between Nebula Graph 1.x and 2.0 are as follows: In Nebula Graph 1.x, a vertex and an edge have the same Type byte, while in Nebula Graph 2.0, the Type byte differs from each other, which separates vertices and edges physically so that all tags of a vertex can be easily queried. Nebula Graph 1.x supports only int IDs, while Nebula Graph 2.0 is compatible with both int IDs and string IDs. Nebula Graph 2.0 removes Timestamp in both vertex and edge key formats. Nebula Graph 2.0 adds PlaceHolder to edge key format. Nebula Graph 2.0 has changed the formats of indexes for a range query. Property descriptions \u00b6 Nebula Graph uses strong-typed Schema. Nebula Graph will store the properties of vertex and edges in order after encoding them. Since the length of properties is fixed, queries can be made in no time according to offset. Before decoding, Nebula Graph needs to get (and cache) the schema information in the Meta Service. In addition, when encoding properties, Nebula Graph will add the corresponding schema version to support online schema change. Data partitioning \u00b6 Since in an ultra-large-scale relational network, vertices can be as many as tens to hundreds of billions, and edges are even more than trillions. Even if only vertices and edges are stored, the storage capacity of both exceeds that of ordinary servers. Therefore, Nebula Graph uses hash to shard the graph elements and store them in different partitions. Edge and storage amplification \u00b6 In Nebula Graph, an edge corresponds to two key-value pairs on the hard disk. When there are lots of edges and each has many properties, storage amplification will be obvious. The storage format of edges is shown in the picture below. In this example, ScrVertex connects DstVertex via EdgeA, forming the path of (SrcVertex)-[EdgeA]->(DstVertex) . ScrVertex, DstVertex, and EdgeA will all be stored in Partition x and Partition y as four key-value pairs in the storage layer. Details are as follows: The key value of SrcVertex is stored in Partition x. Key fields include Type, PartID(x), VID(Src), and TagID. SerializedValue, namely Value, refers to serialized vertex properties. The first key value of EdgeA, namely EdgeA_Out, is stored in the same partition as the ScrVertex. Key fields include Type, PartID(x), VID(Src), EdgeType(+ means out-edge), Rank(0), VID(Dst), and PlaceHolder. SerializedValue, namely Value, refers to serialized edge properties. The key value of DstVertex is stored in Partition y. Key fields include Type, PartID(y), VID(Dst), and TagID. SerializedValue, namely Value, refers to serialized vertex properties. The second key value of EdgeA, namely EdgeA_In, is stored in the same partition as the DstVertex. Key fields include Type, PartID(y), VID(Dst), EdgeType(- means in-edge), Rank(0), VID(Src), and PlaceHolder. SerializedValue, namely Value, refers to serialized edge properties, which is exactly the same as that in EdgeA_Out. EdgeA_Out and EdgeA_In are stored in storage layer with opposite directions, constituting EdgeA logically. EdgeA_Out is used for traversal requests starting from SrcVertex, such as (a)-[]->() ; EdgeA_In is used for traversal requests starting from DstVertex, such as ()-[]->(a) . Like EdgeA_Out and EdgeA_In, Nebula Graph redundantly stores the information of each edge, which doubles the actual capacities needed for edge storage. The key corresponding to the edge occupies a small hard disk space, but the space occupied by Value is proportional to the length and amount of the property value. Therefore, it will occupy a relatively large hard disk space if the property value of the edge is large or there are many edge property values. To ensure the final consistency of the two key-value pairs when operating on edges, enable the TOSS function . After that, the operation will be performed in Partition x first where the out-edge is located, and then in Partition y where the in-edge is located. Finally, the result is returned. Partition algorithm \u00b6 Nebula Graph uses a static Hash strategy to shard data through a modulo operation on vertex ID. All the out-keys, in-keys, and tag data will be placed in the same partition. In this way, query efficiency is increased dramatically. Note The number of partitions needs to be determined when users are creating a graph space since it cannot be changed afterward. Users are supposed to take into consideration the demands of future business when setting it. When inserting into Nebula Graph, vertices and edges are distributed across different partitions. And the partitions are located on different machines. The number of partitions is set in the CREATE SPACE statement and cannot be changed afterward. If certain vertices need to be placed on the same partition (i.e., on the same machine), see Formula/code . The following code will briefly describe the relationship between VID and partition. // If VertexID occupies 8 bytes, it will be stored in int64 to be compatible with the version 1.0. uint64_t vid = 0; if (id.size() == 8) { memcpy(static_cast<void*>(&vid), id.data(), 8); } else { MurmurHash2 hash; vid = hash(id.data()); } PartitionID pId = vid % numParts + 1; Roughly speaking, after hashing a fixed string to int64, (the hashing of int64 is the number itself), do modulo, and then plus one, namely: pId = vid % numParts + 1 ; Parameters and descriptions of the preceding formula are as follows: Parameter Description % The modulo operation. numParts The number of partitions for the graph space where the VID is located, namely the value of partition_num in the CREATE SPACE statement. pId The ID for the partition where the VID is located. Suppose there are 100 partitions, the vertices with VID 1, 101, and 1001 will be stored on the same partition. But, the mapping between the partition ID and the machine address is random. Therefore, we cannot assume that any two partitions are located on the same machine. Raft \u00b6 Raft implementation \u00b6 In a distributed system, one data usually has multiple replicas so that the system can still run normally even if a few copies fail. It requires certain technical means to ensure consistency between replicas. Basic principle: Raft is designed to ensure consistency between replicas. Raft uses election between replicas, and the (candidate) replica that wins more than half of the votes will become the Leader, providing external services on behalf of all replicas. The rest Followers will play backups. When the Leader fails (due to communication failure, operation and maintenance commands, etc.), the rest Followers will conduct a new round of elections and vote for a new Leader. The Leader and Followers will detect each other's survival through heartbeats and write them to the hard disk in Raft-wal mode. Replicas that do not respond to more than multiple heartbeats will be considered faulty. Note Raft-wal needs to be written into the hard disk periodically. If hard disk bottlenecks to write, Raft will fail to send a heartbeat and conduct a new round of elections. If the hard disk IO is severely blocked, there will be no Leader for a long time. Read and write: For every writing request of the clients, the Leader will initiate a Raft-wal and synchronize it with the Followers. Only after over half replicas have received the Raft-wal will it return to the clients successfully. For every reading request of the clients, it will get to the Leader directly, while Followers will not be involved. Failure: Scenario 1: Take a (space) cluster of a single replica as an example. If the system has only one replica, the Leader will be itself. If failure happens, the system will be completely unavailable. Scenario 2: Take a (space) cluster of three replicas as an example. If the system has three replicas, one of them will be the Leader and the rest will be the Followers. If the Leader fails, the rest two can still vote for a new Leader (and a Follower), and the system is still available. But if any of the two Followers fails again, the system will be completely unavailable due to inadequate voters. Note Raft and HDFS have different modes of duplication. Raft is based on a quorum vote, so the number of replicas cannot be even. Listener: As is a special role in Raft, it cannot vote or keep data consistency. In Nebula Graph, it reads Raft-wal from the Leader and synchronizes it to ElasticSearch cluster. Multi Group Raft \u00b6 Storage Service supports a distributed cluster architecture, so Nebula Graph implements Multi Group Raft according to Raft protocol. Each Raft group stores all the replicas of each partition. One replica is the leader, while others are followers. In this way, Nebula Graph achieves strong consistency and high availability. The functions of Raft are as follows. Nebula Graph uses Multi Group Raft to improve performance when there are many partitions because Raft-wal cannot be NULL. When there are too many partitions, costs will increase, such as storing information in Raft group, WAL files, or batch operation in low load. There are two key points to implement the Multi Raft Group: To share transport layer Each Raft Group sends messages to its corresponding peers. So if the transport layer cannot be shared, the connection costs will be very high. To share thread pool Raft Groups share the same thread pool to prevent starting too many threads and a high context switch cost. Batch \u00b6 For each partition, it is necessary to do a batch to improve throughput when writing the WAL serially. As Nebula Graph uses WAL to implement some special functions, batches need to be grouped, which is a feature of Nebula Graph. For example, lock-free CAS operations will execute after all the previous WALs are committed. So for a batch, if there are several WALs in CAS type, we need to divide this batch into several smaller groups and make sure they are committed serially. Listener \u00b6 The Listener is designed for storage horizontal scaling . It takes a long time for the newly added machines to be synchronized with data. Therefore, these machines cannot join the group followers, otherwise, the availability of the entire cluster will decrease. The Listener will write into the command WAL. If the leader finds a command of add learner when writing the WAL, it will add the listener to its peers and mark it as a Listener. Listeners cannot join the quorum votes, but logs will still be sent to them as usual. Listeners themselves will not initiate elections. Raft listener can write the data into Elasticsearch cluster after receiving them from Learner to implement full-text search. For more information, see Deploy Raft Listener . Transfer Leadership \u00b6 Transfer leadership is extremely important for balance. When moving a partition from one machine to another, Nebula Graph first checks if the source is a leader. If so, it should be moved to another peer. After data migration is completed, it is important to balance leader distribution again. When a transfer leadership command is committed, the leader will abandon its leadership and the followers will start a leader election. Peer changes \u00b6 To avoid split-brain, when members in a Raft Group change, an intermediate state is required. In such a state, the quorum of the old group and new group always have an overlap. Thus it prevents the old or new group from making decisions unilaterally. To make it even simpler, in his doctoral thesis Diego Ongaro suggests adding or removing a peer once to ensure the overlap between the quorum of the new group and the old group. Nebula Graph also uses this approach, except that the way to add or remove a member is different. For details, please refer to addPeer/removePeer in the Raft Part class. Differences with HDFS \u00b6 Storage Service is a Raft-based distributed architecture, which has certain differences with that of HDFS. For example: Storage Service ensures consistency through Raft. Usually, the number of its replicas is odd to elect a leader. However, DataNode used by HDFS ensures consistency through NameNode, which has no limit on the number of replicas. In Storage Service, only the replicas of the leader can read and write, while in HDFS all the replicas can do so. In Storage Service, the number of replicas needs to be determined when creating a space, since it cannot be changed afterward. But in HDFS, the number of replicas can be changed freely. Storage Service can access the file system directly. While the applications of HDFS (such as HBase) have to access HDFS before the file system, which requires more RPC times. In a word, Storage Service is more lightweight with some functions simplified and its architecture is simpler than HDFS, which can effectively improve the read and write performance of a smaller block of data.","title":"Storage Service"},{"location":"1.introduction/3.nebula-graph-architecture/4.storage-service/#storage_service","text":"The persistent data of Nebula Graph have two parts.

When moving a partition from one machine to another, Nebula Graph first checks if the source is a leader. If so, it should be moved to another peer.

In such a state, the quorum of the old group and new group always have an overlap. Thus it prevents the old or new group from making decisions unilaterally. To make it even simpler, in his doctoral thesis Diego Ongaro suggests adding or removing a peer once to ensure the overlap between the quorum of the new group and the old group. Nebula Graph also uses this approach, except that the way to add or remove a member is different. For details, please refer to addPeer/removePeer in the Raft Part class.","title":"Peer changes"},{"location":"1.introduction/3.nebula-graph-architecture/4.storage-service/#differences_with_hdfs","text":"Storage Service is a Raft-based distributed architecture, which has certain differences with that of HDFS. For example: Storage Service ensures consistency through Raft. Usually, the number of its replicas is odd to elect a leader. However, DataNode used by HDFS ensures consistency through NameNode, which has no limit on the number of replicas. In Storage Service, only the replicas of the leader can read and write, while in HDFS all the replicas can do so. In Storage Service, the number of replicas needs to be determined when creating a space, since it cannot be changed afterward. But in HDFS, the number of replicas can be changed freely. Storage Service can access the file system directly. While the applications of HDFS (such as HBase) have to access HDFS before the file system, which requires more RPC times. In a word, Storage Service is more lightweight with some functions simplified and its architecture is simpler than HDFS, which can effectively improve the read and write performance of a smaller block of data.","title":"Differences with HDFS"},{"location":"14.client/1.nebula-client/","text":"Clients overview \u00b6 Nebula Graph supports multiple types of clients for users to connect to and manage the Nebula Graph database.

But firstly we suggest you raise an issue on the github or the forum to start a discussion with the community. Check through the topic for Github. Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) \u00b6 What is CLA ? Here is the vesoft inc. Contributor License Agreement . Click the Sign in with GitHub to agree button to sign the CLA. If you have any questions, send an email to info@vesoft.com . Modify a single document \u00b6 This manual is written in the Markdown language. Click the pencil icon on the right of the document title to commit the modification. This method applies to modify a single document only. Batch modify or add files \u00b6 This method applies to contribute codes, modify multiple documents in batches, or add new documents. Step 1: Fork in the github.com \u00b6 The Nebula Graph project has many repositories . Take the nebula-graph repository for example: Visit https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula . Click the Fork button to establish an online fork. Step 2: Clone Fork to Local Storage \u00b6 Define a local working directory. # Define the working directory. working_dir = $HOME /Workspace Set user to match the Github profile name. user ={ the Github profile name } Create your clone. mkdir -p $working_dir cd $working_dir git clone https://github.com/ $user /nebula-graph.git # or: git clone git@github.com:$user/nebula-graph.git cd $working_dir /nebula git remote add upstream https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula.git # or: git remote add upstream git@github.com:vesoft-inc/nebula.git # Never push to upstream master since you do not have write access. git remote set-url --push upstream no_push # Confirm that the remote branch is valid. # The correct format is: # origin git@github.com:$(user)/nebula-graph.git (fetch) # origin git@github.com:$(user)/nebula-graph.git (push) # upstream https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula (fetch) # upstream no_push (push) git remote -v (Optional) Define a pre-commit hook. Please link the Nebula Graph pre-commit hook into the .git directory. This hook checks the commits for formatting, building, doc generation, etc. cd $working_dir /nebula-graph/.git/hooks ln -s $working_dir /nebula-graph/.linters/cpp/hooks/pre-commit.sh . Sometimes, the pre-commit hook cannot be executed. You have to execute it manually. cd $working_dir /nebula-graph/.git/hooks chmod +x pre-commit Step 3: Branch \u00b6 Get your local master up to date. cd $working_dir /nebula git fetch upstream git checkout master git rebase upstream/master Checkout a new branch from master. git checkout -b myfeature Note Because the PR often consists of several commits, which might be squashed while being merged into upstream. We strongly suggest you to open a separate topic branch to make your changes on. After merged, this topic branch can be just abandoned, thus you could synchronize your master branch with upstream easily with a rebase like above. Otherwise, if you commit your changes directly into master, you need to use a hard reset on the master branch. For example: git fetch upstream git checkout master git reset --hard upstream/master git push --force origin master Step 4: Develop \u00b6 Code style Nebula Graph adopts cpplint to make sure that the project conforms to Google's coding style guides. The checker will be implemented before the code is committed. Unit tests requirements Please add unit tests for the new features or bug fixes. Build your code with unit tests enabled For more information, see Install Nebula Graph by compiling the source code . Note Make sure you have enabled the building of unit tests by setting -DENABLE_TESTING=ON . Run tests In the root directory of nebula , run the following command: cd nebula/build ctest -j $( nproc ) Step 5: Bring Your Branch Update to Date \u00b6 # While on your myfeature branch. git fetch upstream git rebase upstream/master Users need to bring the head branch up to date after other contributors merge PR to the base branch. Step 6: Commit \u00b6 Commit your changes. git commit -a Users can use the command --amend to re-edit the previous code. Step 7: Push \u00b6 When ready to review or just to establish an offsite backup, push your branch to your fork on github.com : git push origin myfeature Step 8: Create a Pull Request \u00b6 Visit your fork at https://github.com/$user/nebula-graph (replace $user here). Click the Compare & pull request button next to your myfeature branch. Step 9: Get a Code Review \u00b6 Once your pull request has been created, it will be assigned to at least two reviewers. Those reviewers will do a thorough code review to make sure that the changes meet the repository's contributing guidelines and other quality standards. Add test cases \u00b6 For detailed methods, see How to add test cases . Donation \u00b6 Step 1: Confirm the project donation \u00b6 Contact the official Nebula Graph staff via email, WeChat, Slack, etc. to confirm the donation project. The project will be donated to the Nebula Contrib organization. Email address: info@vesoft.com WeChat: NebulaGraphbot Slack: Join Slack Step 2: Get the information of the project recipient \u00b6 The Nebula Graph official staff will give the recipient ID of the Nebula Contrib project. Step 3: Donate a project \u00b6 The user transfers the project to the recipient of this donation, and the recipient transfers the project to the Nebula Contrib organization. After the donation, the user will continue to lead the development of community projects as a Maintainer.

For more information, see nGQL guide . Graph space and Nebula Graph schema \u00b6 A Nebula Graph instance consists of one or more graph spaces. Graph spaces are physically isolated from each other. You can use different graph spaces in the same instance to store different datasets. To insert data into a graph space, define a schema for the graph database. Nebula Graph schema is based on the following components. Schema component Description Vertex Represents an entity in the real world. A vertex can have one or more tags. Tag The type of the same group of vertices. It defines a set of properties that describes the types of vertices. Edge Represents a directed relationship between two vertices. Edge type The type of an edge. It defines a group of properties that describes the types of edges. For more information, see Data modeling . In this topic, we will use the following dataset to demonstrate basic CRUD operations. Check the machine status in the Nebula Graph cluster \u00b6 Note First, we recommend that you check the machine status to make sure that all the Storage services are connected to the Meta services. Run SHOW HOSTS as follows. nebula> SHOW HOSTS; +-------------+-----------+-----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------------+ | Host | Port | Status | Leader count | Leader distribution | Partition distribution | +-------------+-----------+-----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------------+ | \"storaged0\" | 9779 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | \"No valid partition\" | \"No valid partition\" | | \"storaged1\" | 9779 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | \"No valid partition\" | \"No valid partition\" | | \"storaged2\" | 9779 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | \"No valid partition\" | \"No valid partition\" | | \"Total\" | __EMPTY__ | __EMPTY__ | 0 | __EMPTY__ | __EMPTY__ | +-------------+-----------+-----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------------+ From the Status column of the table in the return results, you can see that all the Storage services are online. Asynchronous implementation of creation and alteration \u00b6 Caution Nebula Graph implements the following creation or alteration operations asynchronously in the next heartbeat cycle. The operations will not take effect until they finish. CREATE SPACE CREATE TAG CREATE EDGE ALTER TAG ALTER EDGE CREATE TAG INDEX CREATE EDGE INDEX Note The default heartbeat interval is 10 seconds. To change the heartbeat interval, modify the heartbeat_interval_secs parameter in the configuration files for all services. To make sure the follow-up operations work as expected, take one of the following approaches: Run SHOW or DESCRIBE statements accordingly to check the status of the objects, and make sure the creation or alteration is complete. If it is not, wait a few seconds and try again. Wait for two heartbeat cycles, i.e., 20 seconds. Create and use a graph space \u00b6 nGQL syntax \u00b6 Create a graph space: CREATE SPACE [IF NOT EXISTS] <graph_space_name> ( [partition_num = <partition_number>,] [replica_factor = <replica_number>,] vid_type = {FIXED_STRING(<N>) | INT64} ) [COMMENT = '<comment>']; For more information on parameters, see CREATE SPACE . List graph spaces and check if the creation is successful: nebula> SHOW SPACES; Use a graph space: USE <graph_space_name>; Examples \u00b6 Use the following statement to create a graph space named basketballplayer . nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer(partition_num=15, replica_factor=1, vid_type=fixed_string(30)); Check the partition distribution with SHOW HOSTS to make sure that the partitions are distributed in a balanced way. nebula> SHOW HOSTS; +-------------+-----------+-----------+--------------+----------------------------------+------------------------+ | Host | Port | Status | Leader count | Leader distribution | Partition distribution | +-------------+-----------+-----------+--------------+----------------------------------+------------------------+ | \"storaged0\" | 9779 | \"ONLINE\" | 5 | \"basketballplayer:5\" | \"basketballplayer:5\" | | \"storaged1\" | 9779 | \"ONLINE\" | 5 | \"basketballplayer:5\" | \"basketballplayer:5\" | | \"storaged2\" | 9779 | \"ONLINE\" | 5 | \"basketballplayer:5\" | \"basketballplayer:5\" | | \"Total\" | | | 15 | \"basketballplayer:15\" | \"basketballplayer:15\" | +-------------+-----------+-----------+--------------+----------------------------------+------------------------+ If the Leader distribution is uneven, use BALANCE LEADER to redistribute the partitions.

Use the basketballplayer graph space. nebula[(none)]> USE basketballplayer; You can use SHOW SPACES to check the graph space you created. nebula> SHOW SPACES; +--------------------+ | Name | +--------------------+ | \"basketballplayer\" | +--------------------+ Create tags and edge types \u00b6 nGQL syntax \u00b6 CREATE {TAG | EDGE} {<tag_name> | <edge_type>}(<property_name> <data_type> [, <property_name> <data_type> ...]) [COMMENT = '<comment>']; For more information on parameters, see CREATE TAG and CREATE EDGE . Examples \u00b6 Create tags player and team , edge types follow and serve . Descriptions are as follows. Component name Type Property player Tag name (string), age (int) team Tag name (string) follow Edge type degree (int) serve Edge type start_year (int), end_year (int) nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int); nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string); nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int); nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int); Insert vertices and edges \u00b6 Users can use the INSERT statement to insert vertices or edges based on existing tags or edge types. nGQL syntax \u00b6 Insert vertices: INSERT VERTEX [IF NOT EXISTS] <tag_name> (<property_name>[, <property_name>...]) [, <tag_name> (<property_name>[, <property_name>...]), ...] {VALUES | VALUE} <vid>: (<property_value>[, <property_value>...]) [, <vid>: (<property_value>[, <property_value>...]; VID is short for Vertex ID. A VID must be a unique string value in a graph space. For details, see INSERT VERTEX . Insert edges: INSERT EDGE [IF NOT EXISTS] <edge_type> (<property_name>[, <property_name>...]) {VALUES | VALUE} <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>] : (<property_value>[, <property_value>...]) [, <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>] : (<property_name>[, <property_name>...]), ...]; For more information on parameters, see INSERT EDGE . Examples \u00b6 Insert vertices representing basketball players and teams: nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name, age) VALUES \"player100\":(\"Tim Duncan\", 42); nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name, age) VALUES \"player101\":(\"Tony Parker\", 36); nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name, age) VALUES \"player102\":(\"LaMarcus Aldridge\", 33); nebula> INSERT VERTEX team(name) VALUES \"team203\":(\"Trail Blazers\"), \"team204\":(\"Spurs\"); Insert edges representing the relations between basketball players and teams: nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(degree) VALUES \"player101\" -> \"player100\":(95); nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(degree) VALUES \"player101\" -> \"player102\":(90); nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(degree) VALUES \"player102\" -> \"player100\":(75); nebula> INSERT EDGE serve(start_year, end_year) VALUES \"player101\" -> \"team204\":(1999, 2018),\"player102\" -> \"team203\":(2006, 2015); Read data \u00b6 The GO statement can traverse the database based on specific conditions. A GO traversal starts from one or more vertices, along one or more edges, and returns information in a form specified in the YIELD clause. The FETCH statement is used to get properties from vertices or edges. The LOOKUP statement is based on indexes . It is used together with the WHERE clause to search for the data that meet the specific conditions. The MATCH statement is the most commonly used statement for graph data querying. It can describe all kinds of graph patterns, but it relies on indexes to match data patterns in Nebula Graph. Therefore, its performance still needs optimization. nGQL syntax \u00b6 GO GO [[<M> TO] <N> STEPS ] FROM <vertex_list> OVER <edge_type_list> [{REVERSELY | BIDIRECT}] [ WHERE <conditions> ] [YIELD [DISTINCT] <return_list>] [{SAMPLE <sample_list> | LIMIT <limit_list>}] [| GROUP BY {col_name | expr | position} YIELD <col_name>] [| ORDER BY <expression> [{ASC | DESC}]] [| LIMIT [<offset>,] <number_rows>]; FETCH Fetch properties on tags: FETCH PROP ON {<tag_name>[, tag_name ...] | *} <vid> [, vid ...] [YIELD <return_list> [AS <alias>]]; Fetch properties on edges: FETCH PROP ON <edge_type> <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>] [, <src_vid> -> <dst_vid> ...] [YIELD <output>]; LOOKUP LOOKUP ON {<vertex_tag> | <edge_type>} [WHERE <expression> [AND <expression> ...]] [YIELD <return_list> [AS <alias>]]; MATCH MATCH <pattern> [<WHERE clause>] RETURN <output>; Examples of GO statement \u00b6 Search for the players that the player with VID player101 follows. nebula> GO FROM \"player101\" OVER follow; +-------------+ | follow._dst | +-------------+ | \"player100\" | | \"player102\" | +-------------+ Filter the players that the player with VID player101 follows whose age is equal to or greater than 35.

With a temporary variable: Note Once a composite statement is submitted to the server as a whole, the life cycle of the temporary variables in the statement ends. nebula> $var = GO FROM \"player101\" OVER follow YIELD dst(edge) AS id; \\ GO FROM $var.id OVER serve YIELD properties($$).name AS Team, \\ properties($^).name AS Player; +-----------------+---------------------+ | Team | Player | +-----------------+---------------------+ | \"Trail Blazers\" | \"LaMarcus Aldridge\" | +-----------------+---------------------+ Example of FETCH statement \u00b6 Use FETCH : Fetch the properties of the player with VID player100 . nebula> FETCH PROP ON player \"player100\"; +----------------------------------------------------+ | vertices_ | +----------------------------------------------------+ | (\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim Duncan\"}) | +----------------------------------------------------+ Note The examples of LOOKUP and MATCH statements are in indexes . Update vertices and edges \u00b6 Users can use the UPDATE or the UPSERT statements to update existing data. UPSERT is the combination of UPDATE and INSERT . If you update a vertex or an edge with UPSERT , the database will insert a new vertex or edge if it does not exist. Note UPSERT operates serially in a partition-based order. Therefore, it is slower than INSERT OR UPDATE . And UPSERT has concurrency only between multiple partitions. nGQL syntax \u00b6 UPDATE vertices: UPDATE VERTEX <vid> SET <properties to be updated> [WHEN <condition>] [YIELD <columns>]; UPDATE edges: UPDATE EDGE <source vid> -> <destination vid> [@rank] OF <edge_type> SET <properties to be updated> [WHEN <condition>] [YIELD <columns to be output>]; UPSERT vertices or edges: UPSERT {VERTEX <vid> | EDGE <edge_type>} SET <update_columns> [WHEN <condition>] [YIELD <columns>]; Examples \u00b6 UPDATE the name property of the vertex with VID player100 and check the result with the FETCH statement. nebula> UPDATE VERTEX \"player100\" SET player.name = \"Tim\"; nebula> FETCH PROP ON player \"player100\"; +---------------------------------------------+ | vertices_ | +---------------------------------------------+ | (\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim\"}) | +---------------------------------------------+ UPDATE the degree property of an edge and check the result with the FETCH statement. nebula> UPDATE EDGE \"player101\" -> \"player100\" OF follow SET degree = 96; nebula> FETCH PROP ON follow \"player101\" -> \"player100\"; +----------------------------------------------------+ | edges_ | +----------------------------------------------------+ | [:follow \"player101\"->\"player100\" @0 {degree: 96}] | +----------------------------------------------------+ Insert a vertex with VID player111 and UPSERT it. nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name,age) values \"player111\":(\"David West\", 38); nebula> UPSERT VERTEX \"player111\" SET player.name = \"David\", player.age = $^.player.age + 11 \\ WHEN $^.player.name == \"David West\" AND $^.player.age > 20 \\ YIELD $^.player.name AS Name, $^.player.age AS Age; +---------+-----+ | Name | Age | +---------+-----+ | \"David\" | 49 | +---------+-----+ Delete vertices and edges \u00b6 nGQL syntax \u00b6 Delete vertices: DELETE VERTEX <vid1>[, <vid2>...] Delete edges: DELETE EDGE <edge_type> <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>] [, <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>...] Examples \u00b6 Delete vertices: nebula> DELETE VERTEX \"player111\", \"team203\"; Delete edges: nebula> DELETE EDGE follow \"player101\" -> \"team204\"; About indexes \u00b6 Users can add indexes to tags and edge types with the CREATE INDEX statement. Must-read for using indexes Both MATCH and LOOKUP statements depend on the indexes. But indexes can dramatically reduce the write performance (as much as 90% or even more). DO NOT use indexes in production environments unless you are fully aware of their influences on your service. Users MUST rebuild indexes for pre-existing data. Otherwise, the pre-existing data cannot be indexed and therefore cannot be returned in MATCH or LOOKUP statements. For more information, see REBUILD INDEX . nGQL syntax \u00b6 Create an index: CREATE {TAG | EDGE} INDEX [IF NOT EXISTS] <index_name> ON {<tag_name> | <edge_name>} ([<prop_name_list>]) [COMMENT = '<comment>']; Rebuild an index: REBUILD {TAG | EDGE} INDEX <index_name>; Note Define the index length when creating an index for a variable-length property. In UTF-8 encoding, a non-ascii character occupies 3 bytes. You should set an appropriate index length according to the variable-length property. For example, the index should be 30 bytes for 10 non-ascii characters. For more information, see CREATE INDEX Examples of LOOKUP and MATCH (index-based) \u00b6 Make sure there is an index for LOOKUP or MATCH to use. If there is not, create an index first. Find the information of the vertex with the tag player and its value of the name property is Tony Parker . This example creates the index player_index_1 on the player name property. nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX player_index_1 ON player(name(20)); This example rebuilds the index to make sure it takes effect on pre-existing data. nebula> REBUILD TAG INDEX player_index_1 +------------+ | New Job Id | +------------+ | 31 | +------------+ Got 1 rows (time spent 2379/3033 us) This example uses the LOOKUP statement to retrieve the vertex property. nebula> LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.name == \"Tony Parker\" \\ YIELD properties(vertex).name AS name, properties(vertex).age AS age; +-------------+---------------+-----+ | VertexID | name | age | +-------------+---------------+-----+ | \"player101\" | \"Tony Parker\" | 36 | +-------------+---------------+-----+ This example uses the MATCH statement to retrieve the vertex property. nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tony Parker\"}) RETURN v; +-----------------------------------------------------+ | v | +-----------------------------------------------------+ | (\"player101\" :player{age: 36, name: \"Tony Parker\"}) | +-----------------------------------------------------+","title":"Step 4 Use nGQL (CRUD)"},{"location":"2.quick-start/4.nebula-graph-crud/#step_4_use_ngql_crud","text":"This topic will describe the basic CRUD operations in Nebula Graph.

General queries statements \u00b6 MATCH MATCH <pattern> [<WHERE clause>] RETURN <output> Pattern Example Description Match vertices (v) You can use a user-defined variable in a pair of parentheses to represent a vertex in a pattern. For example: (v) . Match tags MATCH (v:player) RETURN v You can specify a tag with :<tag_name> after the vertex in a pattern. Match vertex properties MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN v You can specify a vertex property with {<prop_name>: <prop_value>} after the tag in a pattern. Match a VID. MATCH (v) WHERE id(v) == 'player101' RETURN v You can use the VID to match a vertex. The id() function can retrieve the VID of a vertex. Match multiple VIDs. MATCH (v:player { name: 'Tim Duncan' })--(v2) WHERE id(v2) IN [\"player101\", \"player102\"] RETURN v2 To match multiple VIDs, use WHERE id(v) IN [vid_list] .

Match multiple edges MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]->(v2)<-[e:serve]-(v3) RETURN v2, v3 You can extend a pattern to match multiple edges in a path. Match fixed-length paths MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*2]->(v2) RETURN DISTINCT v2 AS Friends You can use the :<edge_type>*<hop> pattern to match a fixed-length path. hop must be a non-negative integer. The data type of e is the list. Match variable-length paths MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*1..3]->(v2) RETURN v2 AS Friends minHop : Optional. It represents the minimum length of the path. minHop : must be a non-negative integer. The default value is 1. maxHop : Required. It represents the maximum length of the path. maxHop must be a non-negative integer. It has no default value. The data type of e is the list. Match variable-length paths with multiple edge types MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow | serve*2]->(v2) RETURN DISTINCT v2 You can specify multiple edge types in a fixed-length or variable-length pattern. In this case, hop , minHop , and maxHop take effect on all edge types. The data type of e is the list. Retrieve vertex or edge information MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN v MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e]->(v2) RETURN e Use RETURN {<vertex_name> | <edge_name>} to retrieve all the information of a vertex or an edge.

Retrieve tags MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN labels(v) Use the labels() function to retrieve the list of tags on a vertex. To retrieve the nth element in the labels(v) list, use labels(v)[n-1] . Retrieve a single property on a vertex or an edge MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN v.age Use RETURN {<vertex_name> | <edge_name>}.<property> to retrieve a single property. Use AS to specify an alias for a property. Retrieve all properties on a vertex or an edge MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]->(v2) RETURN properties(v2) Use the properties() function to retrieve all properties on a vertex or an edge. Retrieve edge types MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e]->() RETURN DISTINCT type(e) Use the type() function to retrieve the matched edge types.

For example: (v) . Match tags MATCH (v:player) RETURN v You can specify a tag with :<tag_name> after the vertex in a pattern. Match vertex properties MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN v You can specify a vertex property with {<prop_name>: <prop_value>} after the tag in a pattern. Match a VID. MATCH (v) WHERE id(v) == 'player101' RETURN v You can use the VID to match a vertex. The id() function can retrieve the VID of a vertex. Match multiple VIDs. MATCH (v:player { name: 'Tim Duncan' })--(v2) WHERE id(v2) IN [\"player101\", \"player102\"] RETURN v2 To match multiple VIDs, use WHERE id(v) IN [vid_list] . Match connected vertices MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})--(v2) RETURN v2.name AS Name You can use the -- symbol to represent edges of both directions and match vertices connected by these edges. You can add a > or < to the -- symbol to specify the direction of an edge. Match paths MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-->(v2) RETURN p Connected vertices and edges form a path. You can use a user-defined variable to name a path as follows. Match edges MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e]-(v2) RETURN e Besides using -- , --> , or <-- to indicate a nameless edge, you can use a user-defined variable in a pair of square brackets to represent a named edge. For example: -[e]- . Match an edge type MATCH ()-[e:follow]-() RETURN e Just like vertices, you can specify an edge type with :<edge_type> in a pattern. For example: -[e:follow]- . Match edge type properties MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow{degree:95}]->(v2) RETURN e You can specify edge type properties with {<prop_name>: <prop_value>} in a pattern. For example: [e:follow{likeness:95}] . Match multiple edge types MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow | :serve]->(v2) RETURN e The | symbol can help matching multiple edge types. For example: [e:follow|:serve] . The English colon (:) before the first edge type cannot be omitted, but the English colon before the subsequent edge type can be omitted, such as [e:follow|serve] . Match multiple edges MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]->(v2)<-[e:serve]-(v3) RETURN v2, v3 You can extend a pattern to match multiple edges in a path. Match fixed-length paths MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*2]->(v2) RETURN DISTINCT v2 AS Friends You can use the :<edge_type>*<hop> pattern to match a fixed-length path. hop must be a non-negative integer. The data type of e is the list. Match variable-length paths MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*1..3]->(v2) RETURN v2 AS Friends minHop : Optional. It represents the minimum length of the path. minHop : must be a non-negative integer. The default value is 1. maxHop : Required. It represents the maximum length of the path. maxHop must be a non-negative integer. It has no default value. The data type of e is the list. Match variable-length paths with multiple edge types MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow | serve*2]->(v2) RETURN DISTINCT v2 You can specify multiple edge types in a fixed-length or variable-length pattern. In this case, hop , minHop , and maxHop take effect on all edge types. The data type of e is the list. Retrieve vertex or edge information MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN v MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e]->(v2) RETURN e Use RETURN {<vertex_name> | <edge_name>} to retrieve all the information of a vertex or an edge. Retrieve VIDs MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN id(v) Use the id() function to retrieve VIDs. Retrieve tags MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN labels(v) Use the labels() function to retrieve the list of tags on a vertex. To retrieve the nth element in the labels(v) list, use labels(v)[n-1] .

You can use the search box in the help center or the search function of the browser to match the questions you are looking for. If the solutions described in this topic cannot solve your problems, ask for help on the Nebula Graph forum or submit an issue on GitHub issue . About manual updates \u00b6 \"Why is the behavior in the manual not consistent with the system?\" \u00b6 Nebula Graph is still under development. Its behavior changes from time to time. Users can submit an issue to inform the team if the manual and the system are not consistent. Note If you find some errors in this topic: Click the pencil button at the top right side of this page. Use markdown to fix this error. Then click \"Commit changes\" at the bottom, which will start a Github pull request. Sign the CLA . This pull request will be merged after the acceptance of at least two reviewers. About legacy version compatibility \u00b6 X version compatibility Neubla Graph master is not compatible with Nebula Graph 1.x nor 2.0-RC in both data formats and RPC-protocols, and vice versa . To upgrade data formats, see Upgrade Nebula Graph to the current version . Users must upgrade all clients . Y version compatibility Data formats of Neubla Graph master are compatible with Nebula Graph 2.0, while their clients are incompatible. About executions \u00b6 Why is there no line separating each row in the returned result of Nebula Graph 2.6.0? \u00b6 This is caused by the release of Nebula Console 2.6.0, not the change of Nebula Graph core. And it will not affect the content of the returned data itself. About dangling edges \u00b6 A dangling edge is an edge that only connects to a single vertex and only one part of the edge connects to the vertex. Dangling edges may appear in Nebula Graph master under unusual conditions. And there is no MERGE statements of openCypher. The guarantee for dangling edges depends entirely on the application level. For more information, see INSERT VERTEX , DELETE VERTEX , INSERT EDGE , DELETE EDGE . \"How to resolve [ERROR (-1005)]: Used memory hits the high watermark(0.800000) of total system memory. ?\" \u00b6 The reason for this error may be that system_memory_high_watermark_ratio specifies the trigger threshold of the memory high watermark alarm mechanism. The default value is 0.8 . If the system memory usage is higher than this value, an alarm mechanism will be triggered, and Nebula Graph will stop querying. Possible solutions are as follows: Clean the system memory to make it below the threshold. Modify the Graph configuration . Add the system_memory_high_watermark_ratio parameter to the configuration files of all Graph servers, and set it greater than 0.8 , such as 0.9 . Note Only the Graph service supports system_memory_high_watermark_ratio , while the Storage and Meta services do not. \"How to resolve the error Storage Error E_RPC_FAILURE ?\" \u00b6 The reason for this error is usually that the storaged process returns too many data back to the graphd process. Possible solutions are as follows: Modify configuration files : Modify the value of --storage_client_timeout_ms in the nebula-graphd.conf file to extend the connection timeout of the Storage client. This configuration is measured in milliseconds (ms). For example, set --storage_client_timeout_ms=60000 . If this parameter is not specified in the nebula-graphd.conf file, specify it manually. Tip: Add --local_config=true at the beginning of the configuration file and restart the service. Optimize the query statement: Reduce queries that scan the entire database. No matter whether LIMIT is used to limit the number of returned results, use the GO statement to rewrite the MATCH statement (the former is optimized, while the latter is not). Check whether the Storaged process has OOM. ( dmesg |grep nebula ). Use better SSD or memory for the Storage Server. Retry. \"How to resolve the error The leader has changed. Try again later ?\" \u00b6 It is a known issue. Just retry 1 to N times, where N is the partition number. The reason is that the meta client needs some heartbeats to update or errors to trigger the new leader information. \"How to resolve the error SemanticError: Missing yield clause. ?\" \u00b6 Starting with Nebula Graph 3.0, the statements LOOKUP , GO , and FETCH must output results with the YIELD clause. For more information, see YIELD . \"How is the time spent value at the end of each return message calculated?\" \u00b6 Take the returned message of SHOW SPACES as an example: nebula> SHOW SPACES; +--------------------+ | Name | +--------------------+ | \"basketballplayer\" | +--------------------+ Got 1 rows (time spent 1235/1934 us) The first number 1235 shows the time spent by the database itself, that is, the time it takes for the query engine to receive a query from the client, fetch the data from the storage server, and perform a series of calculations. The second number 1934 shows the time spent from the client's perspective, that is, the time it takes for the client from sending a request, receiving a response, and displaying the result on the screen. \"Can I set replica_factor as an even number in CREATE SPACE statements, e.g., replica_factor = 2 ?\" \u00b6 NO. The Storage service guarantees its availability based on the Raft consensus protocol. The number of failed replicas must not exceed half of the total replica number. When the number of machines is 1, replica_factor can only be set to 1 . When there are enough machines and replica_factor=2 , if one replica fails, the Storage service fails. No matter replica_factor=3 or replica_factor=4 , if more than one replica fails, the Storage Service fails. To prevent unnecessary waste of resources, we recommend that you set an odd replica number. We suggest that you set replica_factor=3 for a production environment and replica_factor=1 for a test environment. Do not use an even number. \"Is stopping or killing slow queries supported?\" \u00b6 Yes. For more information, see Kill query . \"Why are the query results different when using GO and MATCH to execute the same semantic query?\" \u00b6 The possible reasons are listed as follows. GO statements find the dangling edges. RETURN commands do not specify the sequence. The dense vertex truncation limitation defined by max_edge_returned_per_vertex in the Storage service is triggered. Using different types of paths may cause different query results. GO statements use walk . Both vertices and edges can be repeatedly visited in graph traversal. MATCH statements are compatible with openCypher and use trail . Only vertices can be repeatedly visited in graph traversal. The example is as follows. All queries that start from A with 5 hops will end at C ( A->B->C->D->E->C ). If it is 6 hops, the GO statement will end at D ( A->B->C->D->E->C->D ), because the edge C->D can be visited repeatedly. However, the MATCH statement returns empty, because edges cannot be visited repeatedly. Therefore, using GO and MATCH to execute the same semantic query may cause different query results. For more information, see Wikipedia . \"How to resolve [ERROR (-7)]: SyntaxError: syntax error near ?\" \u00b6 In most cases, a query statement requires a YIELD or a RETURN . Check your query statement to see if YIELD or RETURN is provided. \"How to count the vertices/edges number of each tag/edge type?\" \u00b6 See show-stats . \"How to get all the vertices/edge of each tag/edge type?\" \u00b6 Create and rebuild the index. > CREATE TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS i_player ON player(); > REBUILD TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS i_player; Use LOOKUP or MATCH . For example: > LOOKUP ON player; > MATCH (n:player) RETURN n; For more information, see INDEX , LOOKUP , and MATCH . \"How to get all the vertices/edges without specifying the types?\" \u00b6 By nGQL, you CAN NOT directly getting all the vertices without specifying the tags, neither the edges. E.g., You CAN NOT run MATCH (n) RETURN (n) . An error like can\u2019t solve the start vids from the sentence will be returned. You can use Nebula Algorithm . Or get vertices by each tag, and then group them by yourself. \"How to resolve the error can\u2019t solve the start vids from the sentence ?\" \u00b6 The graphd process requires start vids to begin a graph traversal. The start vids can be specified by the user. For example: > GO FROM ${vids} ... > MATCH (src) WHERE id(src) == ${vids} # The \"start vids\" are explicitly given by ${vids}. It can also be found from a property index. For example: # CREATE TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS i_player ON player(name(20)); # REBUILD TAG INDEX i_player; > LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.name == \"abc\" | ... YIELD ... > MATCH (src) WHERE src.name == \"abc\" ... # The \"start vids\" are found from the property index \"name\". Otherwise, an error like can\u2019t solve the start vids from the sentence will be returned. \"How to resolve the error Wrong vertex id type: 1001 ?\" \u00b6 Check whether the VID is INT64 or FIXED_STRING(N) set by create space . For more information, see create space . \"How to resolve the error The VID must be a 64-bit integer or a string fitting space vertex id length limit. ?\" \u00b6 Check whether the length of the VID exceeds the limitation. For more information, see create space . \"How to resolve the error edge conflict or vertex conflict ?\" \u00b6 Nebula Graph may return such errors when the Storage service receives multiple requests to insert or update the same vertex or edge within milliseconds. Try the failed requests again later. \"How to resolve the error RPC failure in MetaClient: Connection refused ?\" \u00b6 The reason for this error is usually that the metad service status is unusual, or the network of the machine where the metad and graphd services are located is disconnected. Possible solutions are as follows: Check the metad service status on the server where the metad is located. If the service status is unusual, restart the metad service. Use telnet meta-ip:port to check the network status under the server that returns an error. Check the port information in the configuration file. If the port is different from the one used when connecting, use the port in the configuration file or modify the configuration. \"How to resolve the error StorageClientBase.inl:214] Request to \"x.x.x.x\":9779 failed: N6apache6thrift9transport19TTransportExceptionE: Timed Out in nebula-graph.INFO ?\" \u00b6 The reason for this error may be that the amount of data to be queried is too large, and the storaged process has timed out. Possible solutions are as follows: When importing data, set Compaction manually to make read faster. Extend the RPC connection timeout of the Graph service and the Storage service. Modify the value of --storage_client_timeout_ms in the nebula-storaged.conf file. This configuration is measured in milliseconds (ms). The default value is 60000ms. \"How to resolve the error MetaClient.cpp:65] Heartbeat failed, status:Wrong cluster! in nebula-storaged.INFO , or HBProcessor.cpp:54] Reject wrong cluster host \"x.x.x.x\":9771! in nebula-metad.INFO ? \u00b6 The reason for this error may be that the user has modified the IP or the port information of the metad process, or the storage service has joined other clusters before. Possible solutions are as follows: Delete the cluster.id file in the installation directory where the storage machine is deployed (the default installation directory is /usr/local/nebula ), and restart the storaged service. Can non-English characters be used as identifiers, such as the names of graph spaces, tags, edge types, properties, and indexes? \u00b6 No. The names of graph spaces, tags, edge types, properties, and indexes must use English letters, numbers, or underlines. Non-English characters are not currently supported. Meanwhile, the above identifiers are case-sensitive and cannot use Keywords and reserved words . \"How to get the out-degree/the in-degree of a vertex with a given name\"? \u00b6 The out-degree of a vertex refers to the number of edges starting from that vertex, while the in-degree refers to the number of edges pointing to that vertex. nebula > MATCH (s)-[e]->() WHERE id(s) == \"given\" RETURN count(e); #Out-degree nebula > MATCH (s)<-[e]-() WHERE id(s) == \"given\" RETURN count(e); #In-degree \"How to quickly get the out-degree and in-degree of all vertices?\" \u00b6 There is no such command. You can use Nebula Algorithm . \"How to resolve [ERROR (-1005)]: Schema not exist: xxx ?\" \u00b6 If the system returns Schema not exist when querying, make sure that: Whether there is a tag or an edge type in the Schema. -Whether the name of the tag or the edge type is a keyword. If it is a keyword, enclose them with backquotes (`). For more information, see Keywords . About operation and maintenance \u00b6 \"The log files are too large. How to recycle the logs?\" \u00b6 By default, the logs of Nebula Graph are stored in /usr/local/nebula/logs/ . The INFO level log files are nebula-graphd.INFO, nebula-storaged.INFO, nebula-metad.INFO . If an alarm or error occurs, the suffixes are modified as .WARNING or .ERROR . Nebula Graph uses glog to print logs. glog cannot recycle the outdated files. You can use crontab to delete them by yourself. For more information, see Glog should delete old log files automatically . \"How to check the Nebula Graph version?\" \u00b6 If the service is running: run command SHOW HOSTS META in nebula-console . See SHOW HOSTS . If the service is not running: Different installation methods make the method of checking the version different. The instructions are as follows: If the service is not running, run the command ./<binary_name> --version to get the version and the Git commit IDs of the Nebula Graph binary files. For example: $ ./nebula-graphd --version nebula-graphd version 2 .6.0, Git: 3ba41bd, Build Time: Oct 25 2021 19 :34:30 If you deploy Nebula Graph with Docker Compose Check the version of Nebula Graph deployed by Docker Compose. The method is similar to the previous method, except that you have to enter the container first. The commands are as follows: docker exec -it nebula-docker-compose_graphd_1 bash cd bin/ ./nebula-graphd --version If you install Nebula Graph with RPM/DEB package Run rpm -qa |grep nebula to check the version of Nebula Graph. \"How to scale out or scale in?\" \u00b6 Nebula Graph master does not provide any commands or tools to support automatic scale out/in. You can refer to the following steps: Scale out and scale in metad: The metad process can not be scaled out or scale in. The process cannot be moved to a new machine. You cannot add a new metad process to the service. Note You can use the Meta transfer script tool to migrate Meta services. Note that the Meta-related settings in the configuration files of Storage and Graph services need to be modified correspondingly. Scale in graphd: Remove the IP of the graphd process from the code in the client. Close this graphd process. Scale out graphd: Prepare the binary and config files of the graphd process in the new host. Modify the config files and add all existing addresses of the metad processes. Then start the new graphd process. Scale in storaged: (The number of replicas must be greater than 1) See Balance remove command . After the command is finished, stop this storaged process. Scale out storaged: (The number of replicas must be greater than 1) Prepare the binary and config files of the storaged process in the new host, Modify the config files and add all existing addresses of the metad processes. Then start the new storaged process. You also need to run Balance Data and Balance leader after scaling in/out storaged. \"After changing the name of the host, the old one keeps displaying OFFLINE . What should I do?\" \u00b6 Hosts with the status of OFFLINE will be automatically deleted after one day. About connections \u00b6 \"Which ports should be opened on the firewalls?\" \u00b6 If you have not modified the predefined ports in the Configurations , open the following ports for the Nebula Graph services: | Service | Port | |---------+---------------------------| | Meta | 9559, 9560, 19559, 19560 | | Graph | 9669, 19669, 19670 | | Storage | 9777 ~ 9780, 19779, 19780 | If you have customized the configuration files and changed the predefined ports, find the port numbers in your configuration files and open them on the firewalls. For those eco-tools, see the corresponding document. \"How to test whether a port is open or closed?\" \u00b6 You can use telnet as follows to check for port status. telnet <ip> <port> Note If you cannot use the telnet command, check if telnet is installed or enabled on your host. For example: // If the port is open: $ telnet 192 .168.1.10 9669 Trying 192 .168.1.10... Connected to 192 .168.1.10.

This topic will describe the patterns in Nebula Graph, some of which have not yet been implemented. Patterns for vertices \u00b6 A vertex is described using a pair of parentheses and is typically given a name. For example: (a) This simple pattern describes a single vertex and names that vertex using the variable a . Patterns for related vertices \u00b6 A more powerful construct is a pattern that describes multiple vertices and edges between them. Patterns describe an edge by employing an arrow between two vertices. For example: (a)-[]->(b) This pattern describes a very simple data structure: two vertices and a single edge from one to the other. In this example, the two vertices are named as a and b respectively and the edge is directed : it goes from a to b . This manner of describing vertices and edges can be extended to cover an arbitrary number of vertices and the edges between them, for example: (a)-[]->(b)<-[]-(c) Such a series of connected vertices and edges is called a path . Note that the naming of the vertices in these patterns is only necessary when one needs to refer to the same vertex again, either later in the pattern or elsewhere in the query. If not, the name may be omitted as follows: (a)-[]->()<-[]-(c) Patterns for tags \u00b6 Note The concept of tag in nGQL has a few differences from that of label in openCypher. For example, users must create a tag before using it. And a tag also defines the type of properties. In addition to simply describing the vertices in the graphs, patterns can also describe the tags of the vertices. For example: (a:User)-[]->(b) Patterns can also describe a vertex that has multiple tags. For example: (a:User:Admin)-[]->(b) OpenCypher compatibility The MATCH statement in nGQL does not support matching multiple tags with (a:User:Admin) . If users need to match multiple tags, use filtering conditions, such as WHERE \"User\" IN tags(n) AND \"Admin\" IN tags(n) . Patterns for properties \u00b6 Vertices and edges are the fundamental elements in a graph. In nGQL, properties are added to them for richer models. In the patterns, the properties can be expressed as follows: some key-value pairs are enclosed in curly brackets and separated by commas. For example, a vertex with two properties will be like: (a {name: 'Andres', sport: 'Brazilian Ju-Jitsu'}) One of the edges that connect to this vertex can be like: (a)-[{blocked: false}]->(b) Patterns for edges \u00b6 The simplest way to describe an edge is by using the arrow between two vertices, as in the previous examples. Users can describe an edge and its direction using the following statement. If users do not care about its direction, the arrowhead can be omitted. For example: (a)-[]-(b) Like vertices, edges can also be named. A pair of square brackets will be used to separate the arrow and the variable will be placed between them. For example: (a)-[r]->(b) Like the tags on vertices, edges can also have types. To describe an edge with a specific type, use the pattern as follows: (a)-[r:REL_TYPE]->(b) An edge can only have one edge type. But if we'd like to describe some data such that the edge could have a set of types, then they can all be listed in the pattern, separating them with the pipe symbol | like this: (a)-[r:TYPE1|TYPE2]->(b) Like vertices, the name of an edge can be omitted. For example: (a)-[:REL_TYPE]->(b) Variable-length pattern \u00b6 Rather than describing a long path using a sequence of many vertex and edge descriptions in a pattern, many edges (and the intermediate vertices) can be described by specifying a length in the edge description of a pattern. For example: (a)-[*2]->(b) The following pattern describes a graph of three vertices and two edges, all in one path (a path of length 2). It is equivalent to: (a)-[]->()-[]->(b) The range of lengths can also be specified. Such edge patterns are called variable-length edges . For example: (a)-[*3..5]->(b) The preceding example defines a path with a minimum length of 3 and a maximum length of 5. It describes a graph of either 4 vertices and 3 edges, 5 vertices and 4 edges, or 6 vertices and 5 edges, all connected in a single path. The lower bound can be omitted.

In this example, the two vertices are named as a and b respectively and the edge is directed : it goes from a to b . This manner of describing vertices and edges can be extended to cover an arbitrary number of vertices and the edges between them, for example: (a)-[]->(b)<-[]-(c) Such a series of connected vertices and edges is called a path .

For example: (a:User)-[]->(b) Patterns can also describe a vertex that has multiple tags. For example: (a:User:Admin)-[]->(b) OpenCypher compatibility The MATCH statement in nGQL does not support matching multiple tags with (a:User:Admin) .

For example: (a)-[r]->(b) Like the tags on vertices, edges can also have types. To describe an edge with a specific type, use the pattern as follows: (a)-[r:REL_TYPE]->(b) An edge can only have one edge type. But if we'd like to describe some data such that the edge could have a set of types, then they can all be listed in the pattern, separating them with the pipe symbol | like this: (a)-[r:TYPE1|TYPE2]->(b) Like vertices, the name of an edge can be omitted.

OpenCypher compatibility \u00b6 Tags in nGQL are similar to labels in openCypher. But they are also quite different. For example, the ways to create them are different. In openCypher, labels are created together with vertices in CREATE statements. In nGQL, tags are created separately using CREATE TAG statements. Tags in nGQL are more like tables in MySQL. Prerequisites \u00b6 Running the CREATE TAG statement requires some privileges for the graph space. Otherwise, Nebula Graph throws an error. Syntax \u00b6 To create a tag in a specific graph space, you must specify the current working space with the USE statement. CREATE TAG [IF NOT EXISTS] <tag_name> ( <prop_name> <data_type> [NULL | NOT NULL] [DEFAULT <default_value>] [COMMENT '<comment>'] [{, <prop_name> <data_type> [NULL | NOT NULL] [DEFAULT <default_value>] [COMMENT '<comment>']} ...] ) [TTL_DURATION = <ttl_duration>] [TTL_COL = <prop_name>] [COMMENT = '<comment>']; Parameter Description IF NOT EXISTS Detects if the tag that you want to create exists. If it does not exist, a new one will be created. The tag existence detection here only compares the tag names (excluding properties). <tag_name> The tag name must be unique in a graph space. Once the tag name is set, it can not be altered. The rules for permitted tag names are the same as those for graph space names. For prohibited names, see Keywords and reserved words . <prop_name> The name of the property. It must be unique for each tag. The rules for permitted property names are the same as those for tag names. <data_type> Shows the data type of each property. For a full description of the property data types, see Data types and Boolean . NULL \\| NOT NULL Specifies if the property supports NULL | NOT NULL . The default value is NULL . DEFAULT Specifies a default value for a property. The default value can be a literal value or an expression supported by Nebula Graph. If no value is specified, the default value is used when inserting a new vertex. COMMENT The remarks of a certain property or the tag itself. The maximum length is 256 bytes. By default, there will be no comments on a tag. TTL_DURATION Specifies the life cycle for the property. The property that exceeds the specified TTL expires. The expiration threshold is the TTL_COL value plus the TTL_DURATION . The default value of TTL_DURATION is 0 . It means the data never expires. TTL_COL Specifies the property to set a timeout on. The data type of the property must be int or timestamp . A tag can only specify one field as TTL_COL . For more information on TTL, see TTL options . Examples \u00b6 nebula> CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS player(name string, age int); # The following example creates a tag with no properties. nebula> CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS no_property(); # The following example creates a tag with a default value. nebula> CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS player_with_default(name string, age int DEFAULT 20); # In the following example, the TTL of the create_time field is set to be 100 seconds. nebula> CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS woman(name string, age int, \\ married bool, salary double, create_time timestamp) \\ TTL_DURATION = 100, TTL_COL = \"create_time\"; Implementation of the operation \u00b6 Trying to use a newly created tag may fail because the creation of the tag is implemented asynchronously. Nebula Graph implements the creation of the tag in the next heartbeat cycle.

For how to create tags or edge types, see CREATE TAG and CREATE EDGE . For how to create full-text indexes, see Deploy full-text index . Must-read for using indexes \u00b6 The concept and using restrictions of indexes are comparatively complex. You can use it together with LOOKUP and MATCH statements. You can use CREATE INDEX to add native indexes for the existing tags, edge types, or properties. They are usually called as tag indexes, edge type indexes, and property indexes. Tag indexes and edge type indexes apply to queries related to the tag and the edge type, but do not apply to queries that are based on certain properties on the tag. For example, you can use LOOKUP to retrieve all the vertices with the tag player . Property indexes apply to property-based queries. For example, you can use the age property to retrieve the VID of all vertices that meet age == 19 . If a property index i_TA is created for the property A of the tag T , the indexes can be replaced as follows (the same for edge type indexes): The query engine can use i_TA to replace i_T . In the MATCH statement, i_T cannot replace i_TA for querying properties. In the LOOKUP statement, i_T may replace i_TA for querying properties. Legacy version compatibility In previous releases, the tag or edge type index in the LOOKUP statement cannot replace the property index for property queries. Although the same results can be obtained by using alternative indexes for queries, the query performance varies according to the selected index. Caution Indexes can dramatically reduce the write performance. The performance reduction can be as much as 90% or even more. DO NOT use indexes in production environments unless you are fully aware of their influences on your service. Indexes cannot make queries faster. It can only locate a vertex or an edge according to properties or count the number of vertices or edges. Long indexes decrease the scan performance of the Storage Service and use more memory. We suggest that you set the indexing length the same as that of the longest string to be indexed. The longest index length is 255 bytes. Strings longer than 255 bytes will be truncated. If you must use indexes, we suggest that you: Import the data into Nebula Graph. Create indexes. Rebuild indexes . After the index is created and the data is imported, you can use LOOKUP or MATCH to retrieve the data. You do not need to specify which indexes to use in a query, Nebula Graph figures that out by itself. Note If you create an index before importing the data, the importing speed will be extremely slow due to the reduction in the write performance. Keep --disable_auto_compaction = false during daily incremental writing. The newly created index will not take effect immediately. Trying to use a newly created index (such as LOOKUP or REBUILD INDEX ) may fail and return can't find xxx in the space because the creation is implemented asynchronously.

To change the heartbeat interval, modify the heartbeat_interval_secs in the configuration files for all services.

PROFILE executes the statement, then outputs the execution plan as well as the execution profile. You can optimize the queries for better performance according to the execution plan and profile. Execution Plan \u00b6 The execution plan is determined by the execution planner in the Nebula Graph query engine. The execution planner processes the parsed nGQL statements into actions . An action is the smallest unit that can be executed. A typical action fetches all neighbors of a given vertex, gets the properties of an edge, and filters vertices or edges based on the given conditions. Each action is assigned to an operator that performs the action. For example, a SHOW TAGS statement is processed into two actions and assigned to a Start operator and a ShowTags operator , while a more complex GO statement may be processed into more than 10 actions and assigned to 10 operators. Syntax \u00b6 EXPLAIN EXPLAIN [format=\"row\" | \"dot\"] <your_nGQL_statement>; PROFILE PROFILE [format=\"row\" | \"dot\"] <your_nGQL_statement>; Output formats \u00b6 The output of an EXPLAIN or a PROFILE statement has two formats, the default row format and the dot format.

For example, \"POINT(3 8)\" means that the longitude is 3\u00b0 and the latitude is 8\u00b0 . Multiple points can form a linestring or a polygon. Shape Example Description Point \"POINT(3 8)\" Specifies the data type as a point. LineString \"LINESTRING(3 8, 4.7 73.23)\" Specifies the data type as a linestring. Polygon \"POLYGON((0 1, 1 2, 2 3, 0 1))\" Specifies the data type as a polygon.

Syntax \u00b6 The syntax of MATCH is relatively more flexible compared with that of other query statements such as GO or LOOKUP . But generally, it can be summarized as follows. MATCH <pattern> [<WHERE clause>] RETURN <output>; The workflow of MATCH \u00b6 The MATCH statement uses a native index to locate a source vertex or an edge. The source vertex or the edge can be in any position in the pattern. In other words, in a valid MATCH statement, there must be an indexed property, a tag, or an edge type. Or the VID of a specific vertex must be specified with the id() function in the WHERE clause. For how to create an index, see create native index . The MATCH statement searches through the pattern to match edges or vertices. Note The path type of the MATCH statement is trail . That is, only vertices can be repeatedly visited in the graph traversal. Edges cannot be repeatedly visited. For details, see path . The MATCH statement retrieves data according to the RETURN clause. OpenCypher compatibility \u00b6 For now, nGQL does not support traversing all vertices and edges with MATCH , such as MATCH (v) RETURN v . However, after the index of a certain tag is created, all corresponding vertices can be traversed, such as MATCH (v:T1) RETURN v . Graph pattern is not supported in the WHERE clause. Using patterns in MATCH statements \u00b6 Prerequisites \u00b6 Make sure there is at least one index in the MATCH statement, or there is a specified VID. If you want to create an index, but there are already related vertices, edges, or properties, you must rebuild indexes after creating the index to make it valid. Caution Correct use of indexes can speed up queries, but indexes can dramatically reduce the write performance. The performance reduction can be as much as 90% or even more. DO NOT use indexes in production environments unless you are fully aware of their influences on your service. # The following example creates an index on both the name property of the tag player and the edge type follow. nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS name ON player(name(20)); nebula> CREATE EDGE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS follow_index on follow(); # The following example rebuilds the index. nebula> REBUILD TAG INDEX name; +------------+ | New Job Id | +------------+ | 121 | +------------+ nebula> REBUILD EDGE INDEX follow_index; +------------+ | New Job Id | +------------+ | 122 | +------------+ # The following example makes sure the index is rebuilt successfully. nebula> SHOW JOB 121; +----------------+---------------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+ | Job Id(TaskId) | Command(Dest) | Status | Start Time | Stop Time | +----------------+---------------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+ | 121 | \"REBUILD_TAG_INDEX\" | \"FINISHED\" | 2021-05-27T02:18:02.000000 | 2021-05-27T02:18:02.000000 | | 0 | \"storaged1\" | \"FINISHED\" | 2021-05-27T02:18:02.000000 | 2021-05-27T02:18:02.000000 | | 1 | \"storaged0\" | \"FINISHED\" | 2021-05-27T02:18:02.000000 | 2021-05-27T02:18:02.000000 | | 2 | \"storaged2\" | \"FINISHED\" | 2021-05-27T02:18:02.000000 | 2021-05-27T02:18:02.000000 | +----------------+---------------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+ nebula> SHOW JOB 122; +----------------+----------------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+ | Job Id(TaskId) | Command(Dest) | Status | Start Time | Stop Time | +----------------+----------------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+ | 122 | \"REBUILD_EDGE_INDEX\" | \"FINISHED\" | 2021-05-27T02:18:11.000000 | 2021-05-27T02:18:11.000000 | | 0 | \"storaged1\" | \"FINISHED\" | 2021-05-27T02:18:11.000000 | 2021-05-27T02:18:21.000000 | | 1 | \"storaged0\" | \"FINISHED\" | 2021-05-27T02:18:11.000000 | 2021-05-27T02:18:21.000000 | | 2 | \"storaged2\" | \"FINISHED\" | 2021-05-27T02:18:11.000000 | 2021-05-27T02:18:21.000000 | +----------------+----------------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+ Match vertices \u00b6 You can use a user-defined variable in a pair of parentheses to represent a vertex in a pattern. For example: (v) . Match tags \u00b6 Note The prerequisite for matching a tag is that the tag itself has an index or a certain property of the tag has an index. Otherwise, you cannot execute the MATCH statement based on the tag. You can specify a tag with :<tag_name> after the vertex in a pattern. nebula> MATCH (v:player) \\ RETURN v; +---------------------------------------------------------------+ | v | +---------------------------------------------------------------+ | (\"player105\" :player{age: 31, name: \"Danny Green\"}) | | (\"player109\" :player{age: 34, name: \"Tiago Splitter\"}) | | (\"player111\" :player{age: 38, name: \"David West\"}) | ... Match vertex properties \u00b6 Note The prerequisite for matching a vertex property is that the tag itself has an index of the corresponding property. Otherwise, you cannot execute the MATCH statement to match the property. You can specify a vertex property with {<prop_name>: <prop_value>} after the tag in a pattern. # The following example uses the name property to match a vertex. nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) \\ RETURN v; +----------------------------------------------------+ | v | +----------------------------------------------------+ | (\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim Duncan\"}) | +----------------------------------------------------+ The WHERE clause can do the same thing: nebula> MATCH (v:player) \\ WHERE v.name == \"Tim Duncan\" \\ RETURN v; +----------------------------------------------------+ | v | +----------------------------------------------------+ | (\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim Duncan\"}) | +----------------------------------------------------+ OpenCypher compatibility In openCypher 9, = is the equality operator. However, in nGQL, == is the equality operator and = is the assignment operator (as in C++ or Java). Match VIDs \u00b6 You can use the VID to match a vertex. The id() function can retrieve the VID of a vertex. nebula> MATCH (v) \\ WHERE id(v) == 'player101' \\ RETURN v; +-----------------------------------------------------+ | v | +-----------------------------------------------------+ | (\"player101\" :player{age: 36, name: \"Tony Parker\"}) | +-----------------------------------------------------+ To match multiple VIDs, use WHERE id(v) IN [vid_list] . nebula> MATCH (v:player { name: 'Tim Duncan' })--(v2) \\ WHERE id(v2) IN [\"player101\", \"player102\"] \\ RETURN v2; +-----------------------------------------------------------+ | v2 | +-----------------------------------------------------------+ | (\"player101\" :player{age: 36, name: \"Tony Parker\"}) | | (\"player101\" :player{age: 36, name: \"Tony Parker\"}) | | (\"player102\" :player{age: 33, name: \"LaMarcus Aldridge\"}) | +-----------------------------------------------------------+ Match connected vertices \u00b6 You can use the -- symbol to represent edges of both directions and match vertices connected by these edges. Legacy version compatibility In nGQL 1.x, the -- symbol is used for inline comments. Starting from nGQL 2.x, the -- symbol represents an incoming or outgoing edge. nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})--(v2) \\ RETURN v2.name AS Name; +---------------------+ | Name | +---------------------+ | \"Spurs\" | | \"Tony Parker\" | | \"LaMarcus Aldridge\" | | \"Marco Belinelli\" | ... You can add a > or < to the -- symbol to specify the direction of an edge. In the following example, --> represents an edge that starts from v and points to v2 . To v , this is an outgoing edge, and to v2 this is an incoming edge. nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-->(v2) \\ RETURN v2.name AS Name; +-----------------+ | Name | +-----------------+ | \"Spurs\" | | \"Tony Parker\" | | \"Manu Ginobili\" | +-----------------+ To extend the pattern, you can add more vertices and edges. nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-->(v2)<--(v3) \\ RETURN v3.name AS Name; +---------------------+ | Name | +---------------------+ | \"Dejounte Murray\" | | \"LaMarcus Aldridge\" | | \"Marco Belinelli\" | ... If you do not need to refer to a vertex, you can omit the variable representing it in the parentheses. nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-->()<--(v3) \\ RETURN v3.name AS Name; +---------------------+ | Name | +---------------------+ | \"Dejounte Murray\" | | \"LaMarcus Aldridge\" | | \"Marco Belinelli\" | ... Match paths \u00b6 Connected vertices and edges form a path. You can use a user-defined variable to name a path as follows. nebula> MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-->(v2) \\ RETURN p; +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | p | +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | <(\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim Duncan\"})-[:serve@0 {end_year: 2016, start_year: 1997}]->(\"team204\" :team{name: \"Spurs\"})> | | <(\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim Duncan\"})-[:follow@0 {degree: 95}]->(\"player101\" :player{age: 36, name: \"Tony Parker\"})> | | <(\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim Duncan\"})-[:follow@0 {degree: 95}]->(\"player125\" :player{age: 41, name: \"Manu Ginobili\"})> | +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ OpenCypher compatibility In nGQL, the @ symbol represents the rank of an edge, but openCypher has no such concept. Match edges \u00b6 Besides using -- , --> , or <-- to indicate a nameless edge, you can use a user-defined variable in a pair of square brackets to represent a named edge. For example: -[e]- . nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e]-(v2) \\ RETURN e; +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | e | +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | [:serve \"player100\"->\"team204\" @0 {end_year: 2016, start_year: 1997}] | | [:follow \"player101\"->\"player100\" @0 {degree: 95}] | | [:follow \"player102\"->\"player100\" @0 {degree: 75}] | ... Match edge types \u00b6 Just like vertices, you can specify edge types with :<edge_type> in a pattern. For example: -[e:follow]- . nebula> MATCH ()-[e:follow]-() \\ RETURN e; +-----------------------------------------------------+ | e | +-----------------------------------------------------+ | [:follow \"player104\"->\"player105\" @0 {degree: 60}] | | [:follow \"player113\"->\"player105\" @0 {degree: 99}] | | [:follow \"player105\"->\"player100\" @0 {degree: 70}] | ... Match edge type properties \u00b6 Note The prerequisite for matching an edge type property is that the edge type itself has an index of the corresponding property. Otherwise, you cannot execute the MATCH statement to match the property. You can specify edge type properties with {<prop_name>: <prop_value>} in a pattern. For example: [e:follow{likeness:95}] . nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow{degree:95}]->(v2) \\ RETURN e; +--------------------------------------------------------+ | e | +--------------------------------------------------------+ | [:follow \"player100\"->\"player101\" @0 {degree: 95}] | | [:follow \"player100\"->\"player125\" @0 {degree: 95}] | +--------------------------------------------------------+ Match multiple edge types \u00b6 The | symbol can help matching multiple edge types. For example: [e:follow|:serve] . The English colon (:) before the first edge type cannot be omitted, but the English colon before the subsequent edge type can be omitted, such as [e:follow|serve] . nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow|:serve]->(v2) \\ RETURN e; +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | e | +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | [:follow \"player100\"->\"player101\" @0 {degree: 95}] | | [:follow \"player100\"->\"player125\" @0 {degree: 95}] | | [:serve \"player100\"->\"team204\" @0 {end_year: 2016, start_year: 1997}] | +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+ Match multiple edges \u00b6 You can extend a pattern to match multiple edges in a path. nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]->(v2)<-[e:serve]-(v3) \\ RETURN v2, v3; +----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+ | v2 | v3 | +----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+ | (\"team204\" :team{name: \"Spurs\"}) | (\"player104\" :player{age: 32, name: \"Marco Belinelli\"}) | | (\"team204\" :team{name: \"Spurs\"}) | (\"player101\" :player{age: 36, name: \"Tony Parker\"}) | | (\"team204\" :team{name: \"Spurs\"}) | (\"player102\" :player{age: 33, name: \"LaMarcus Aldridge\"}) | ... Match fixed-length paths \u00b6 You can use the :<edge_type>*<hop> pattern to match a fixed-length path. hop must be a non-negative integer. nebula> MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*2]->(v2) \\ RETURN DISTINCT v2 AS Friends; +-----------------------------------------------------------+ | Friends | +-----------------------------------------------------------+ | (\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim Duncan\"}) | | (\"player125\" :player{age: 41, name: \"Manu Ginobili\"}) | | (\"player102\" :player{age: 33, name: \"LaMarcus Aldridge\"}) | +-----------------------------------------------------------+ If hop is 0, the pattern will match the source vertex of the path. nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) -[*0]-> (v2) \\ RETURN v2; +----------------------------------------------------+ | v2 | +----------------------------------------------------+ | (\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim Duncan\"}) | +----------------------------------------------------+ Note When you conditionally filter on multi-hop edges, such as -[e:follow*2]-> , note that the e is a list of edges instead of a single edge. For example, the following statement is correct from the syntax point of view which may not get your expected query result, because the e is a list without the .degree property. nebula> MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*2]->(v2) \\ WHERE e.degree > 1 \\ RETURN DISTINCT v2 AS Friends; The correct statement is as follows: nebula> MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*2]->(v2) \\ WHERE ALL(e_ in e WHERE e_.degree > 0) \\ RETURN DISTINCT v2 AS Friends; Further, the following statement is for filtering the properties of the first-hop edge in multi-hop edges: nebula> MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*2]->(v2) \\ WHERE e[0].degree > 98 \\ RETURN DISTINCT v2 AS Friends; Match variable-length paths \u00b6 You can use the :<edge_type>*[minHop]..<maxHop> pattern to match variable-length paths. Parameter Description minHop Optional. It represents the minimum length of the path. minHop must be a non-negative integer. The default value is 1. maxHop Required. It represents the maximum length of the path. maxHop must be a non-negative integer. It has no default value. OpenCypher compatibility In openCypher, maxHop is optional and defaults to infinity. When no bounds are given, .. can be omitted. However, in nGQL, maxHop is required. And .. cannot be omitted. nebula> MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*1..3]->(v2) \\ RETURN v2 AS Friends; +-----------------------------------------------------------+ | Friends | +-----------------------------------------------------------+ | (\"player101\" :player{age: 36, name: \"Tony Parker\"}) | | (\"player125\" :player{age: 41, name: \"Manu Ginobili\"}) | | (\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim Duncan\"}) | ... You can use the DISTINCT keyword to aggregate duplicate results. nebula> MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*1..3]->(v2:player) \\ RETURN DISTINCT v2 AS Friends, count(v2); +-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------+ | Friends | count(v2) | +-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------+ | (\"player102\" :player{age: 33, name: \"LaMarcus Aldridge\"}) | 1 | | (\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim Duncan\"}) | 4 | | (\"player101\" :player{age: 36, name: \"Tony Parker\"}) | 3 | | (\"player125\" :player{age: 41, name: \"Manu Ginobili\"}) | 3 | +-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------+ If minHop is 0 , the pattern will match the source vertex of the path. Compared to the preceding statement, the following example uses 0 as the minHop . So in the following result set, \"Tim Duncan\" is counted one more time than it is in the preceding result set because it is the source vertex. nebula> MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*0..3]->(v2:player) \\ RETURN DISTINCT v2 AS Friends, count(v2); +-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------+ | Friends | count(v2) | +-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------+ | (\"player102\" :player{age: 33, name: \"LaMarcus Aldridge\"}) | 1 | | (\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim Duncan\"}) | 5 | | (\"player125\" :player{age: 41, name: \"Manu Ginobili\"}) | 3 | | (\"player101\" :player{age: 36, name: \"Tony Parker\"}) | 3 | +-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------+ Match variable-length paths with multiple edge types \u00b6 You can specify multiple edge types in a fixed-length or variable-length pattern. In this case, hop , minHop , and maxHop take effect on all edge types. nebula> MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow|serve*2]->(v2) \\ RETURN DISTINCT v2; +-----------------------------------------------------------+ | v2 | +-----------------------------------------------------------+ | (\"team204\" :team{name: \"Spurs\"}) | | (\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim Duncan\"}) | | (\"team215\" :team{name: \"Hornets\"}) | | (\"player125\" :player{age: 41, name: \"Manu Ginobili\"}) | | (\"player102\" :player{age: 33, name: \"LaMarcus Aldridge\"}) | +-----------------------------------------------------------+ Common retrieving operations \u00b6 Retrieve vertex or edge information \u00b6 Use RETURN {<vertex_name> | <edge_name>} to retrieve all the information of a vertex or an edge. nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) \\ RETURN v; +----------------------------------------------------+ | v | +----------------------------------------------------+ | (\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim Duncan\"}) | +----------------------------------------------------+ nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e]->(v2) \\ RETURN e; +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | e | +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | [:serve \"player100\"->\"team204\" @0 {end_year: 2016, start_year: 1997}] | | [:follow \"player100\"->\"player101\" @0 {degree: 95}] | | [:follow \"player100\"->\"player125\" @0 {degree: 95}] | +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ Retrieve VIDs \u00b6 Use the id() function to retrieve VIDs. nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) \\ RETURN id(v); +-------------+ | id(v) | +-------------+ | \"player100\" | +-------------+ Retrieve tags \u00b6 Use the labels() function to retrieve the list of tags on a vertex. nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) \\ RETURN labels(v); +------------+ | labels(v) | +------------+ | [\"player\"] | +------------+ To retrieve the nth element in the labels(v) list, use labels(v)[n-1] .

That is, the output of GO 0 TO 2 and GO 1 TO 2 are the same. <vertex_list> : represents a list of vertex IDs separated by commas, or a special place holder $-.id . For more information, see Pipe . <edge_type_list> : represents a list of edge types which the traversal can go through. REVERSELY | BIDIRECT : defines the direction of the query. By default, the GO statement searches for outgoing edges of <vertex_list> . If REVERSELY is set, GO searches for incoming edges. If BIDIRECT is set, GO searches for edges of both directions.

You can use LOOKUP for the following purposes: Search for the specific data based on conditions defined by the WHERE clause. List vertices with a tag: retrieve the VID of all vertices with a tag.

OpenCypher compatibility \u00b6 This topic applies to native nGQL only. Precautions \u00b6 Correct use of indexes can speed up queries, but indexes can dramatically reduce the write performance. The performance reduction can be 90% or even more. DO NOT use indexes in production environments unless you are fully aware of their influences on your service. If the specified property is not indexed when using the LOOKUP statement, Nebula Graph randomly selects one of the available indexes. For example, the tag player has two properties, name and age . Both the tag player itself and the property name have indexes, but the property age has no indexes. When running LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.age == 36 YIELD player.name; , Nebula Graph randomly uses one of the indexes of the tag player and the property name . Legacy version compatibility In the previous releases, if the specified property is not indexed when using the LOOKUP statement, Nebula Graph reports an error and does not use other indexes. Prerequisites \u00b6 Before using the LOOKUP statement, make sure that at least one index is created.

The usage of LIMIT in native nGQL statements and openCypher compatible statements is different. Native nGQL: Generally, a pipe | needs to be used before the LIMIT clause. The offset parameter can be set or omitted directly after the LIMIT statement. OpenCypher compatible statements: No pipes are permitted before the LIMIT clause. And you can use SKIP to indicate an offset. Note When using LIMIT in either syntax above, it is important to use an ORDER BY clause that constrains the output into a unique order. Otherwise, you will get an unpredictable subset of the output. Legacy version compatibility In Nebula Graph 2.6.0, GO statements support the new LIMIT syntax. Some operators related to LIMIT support computing pushdown. LIMIT in native nGQL statements \u00b6 In native nGQL, LIMIT has general syntax and exclusive syntax in GO statements. General LIMIT syntax in native nGQL statements \u00b6 In native nGQL, the general LIMIT syntax works the same as in SQL . The LIMIT clause accepts one or two parameters. The values of both parameters must be non-negative integers and be used after a pipe. The syntax and description are as follows: ... | LIMIT [<offset>,] <number_rows>; Parameter Description offset The offset value. It defines the row from which to start returning. The offset starts from 0 . The default value is 0 , which returns from the first row. number_rows It constrains the total number of returned rows. For example: # The following example returns the top 3 rows of data from the result. nebula> LOOKUP ON player |\\ LIMIT 3; +-------------+ | VertexID | +-------------+ | \"player100\" | | \"player101\" | | \"player102\" | +-------------+ # The following example returns the 3 rows of data starting from the second row of the sorted output. nebula> GO FROM \"player100\" OVER follow REVERSELY \\ YIELD properties($$).name AS Friend, properties($$).age AS Age \\ | ORDER BY $-.Age, $-.Friend \\ | LIMIT 1, 3; +-------------------+-----+ | Friend | Age | +-------------------+-----+ | \"Danny Green\" | 31 | | \"Aron Baynes\" | 32 | | \"Marco Belinelli\" | 32 | +-------------------+-----+ LIMIT in GO statements \u00b6 In addition to the general syntax in the native nGQL, the LIMIT in the GO statement also supports limiting the number of output results based on edges. Syntax: <go_statement> LIMIT <limit_list>; limit_list is a list. Elements in the list must be natural numbers, and the number of elements must be the same as the maximum number of STEPS in the GO statement. The following takes GO 1 TO 3 STEPS FROM \"A\" OVER * LIMIT <limit_list> as an example to introduce this usage of LIMIT in detail. The list limit_list must contain 3 natural numbers, such as GO 1 TO 3 STEPS FROM \"A\" OVER * LIMIT [1,2,4] . 1 in LIMIT [1,2,4] means that the system automatically selects 1 edge to continue traversal in the first step. 2 means to select 2 edges to continue traversal in the second step. 4 indicates that 4 edges are selected to continue traversal in the third step. Because GO 1 TO 3 STEPS means to return all the traversal results from the first to third steps, all the red edges and their source and destination vertices in the figure below will be matched by this GO statement. And the yellow edges represent there is no path selected when the GO statement traverses. If it is not GO 1 TO 3 STEPS but GO 3 STEPS , it will only match the red edges of the third step and the vertices at both ends. In the basketballplayer dataset, the example is as follows: nebula> GO 3 STEPS FROM \"player100\" \\ OVER * \\ YIELD properties($$).name AS NAME, properties($$).age AS Age \\ LIMIT [3,3,3]; +-----------------+--------------+ | NAME | Age | +-----------------+--------------+ | \"Spurs\" | UNKNOWN_PROP | | \"Tony Parker\" | 36 | | \"Manu Ginobili\" | 41 | +-----------------+--------------+ nebula> GO 3 STEPS FROM \"player102\" \\ OVER * \\ LIMIT [rand32(5),rand32(5),rand32(5)]; +------------+-------------+---------------------+ | serve._dst | follow._dst | any_shape_edge._dst | +------------+-------------+---------------------+ | \"team204\" | | | | \"team215\" | | | | | \"player100\" | | +------------+-------------+---------------------+ LIMIT in openCypher compatible statements \u00b6 In openCypher compatible statements such as MATCH , there is no need to use a pipe when LIMIT is used. The syntax and description are as follows: ... [SKIP <offset>] [LIMIT <number_rows>]; Parameter Description offset The offset value. It defines the row from which to start returning. The offset starts from 0 . The default value is 0 , which returns from the first row. number_rows It constrains the total number of returned rows. Both offset and number_rows accept expressions, but the result of the expression must be a non-negative integer. Note Fraction expressions composed of two integers are automatically floored to integers. For example, 8/6 is floored to 1.

Elements in the list must be natural numbers, and the number of elements must be the same as the maximum number of STEPS in the GO statement. The following takes GO 1 TO 3 STEPS FROM \"A\" OVER * LIMIT <limit_list> as an example to introduce this usage of LIMIT in detail. The list limit_list must contain 3 natural numbers, such as GO 1 TO 3 STEPS FROM \"A\" OVER * LIMIT [1,2,4] . 1 in LIMIT [1,2,4] means that the system automatically selects 1 edge to continue traversal in the first step. 2 means to select 2 edges to continue traversal in the second step. 4 indicates that 4 edges are selected to continue traversal in the third step. Because GO 1 TO 3 STEPS means to return all the traversal results from the first to third steps, all the red edges and their source and destination vertices in the figure below will be matched by this GO statement. And the yellow edges represent there is no path selected when the GO statement traverses.

If it does not exist, a new one will be created. The graph space existence detection here only compares the graph space name (excluding properties). <graph_space_name> Uniquely identifies a graph space in a Nebula Graph instance. The name of the graph space is case-sensitive and allows letters, numbers, or underlines. Keywords and reserved words are not allowed. partition_num Specifies the number of partitions in each replica. The suggested number is five times the number of the hard disks in the cluster. For example, if you have 3 hard disks in the cluster, we recommend that you set 15 partitions. The default value is 100. replica_factor Specifies the number of replicas in the cluster. The suggested number is 3 in a production environment and 1 in a test environment. The replica number must be an odd number for the need of quorum-based voting.

For CentOS, RedHat, and Fedora users, run the following commands. $ yum update $ yum install -y make \\ m4 \\ git \\ wget \\ unzip \\ xz \\ readline-devel \\ ncurses-devel \\ zlib-devel \\ gcc \\ gcc-c++ \\ cmake \\ gettext \\ curl \\ redhat-lsb-core \\ bzip2 // For CentOS 8 +, RedHat 8 +, and Fedora, install libstdc++-static and libasan as well $ yum install -y libstdc++-static libasan For Debian and Ubuntu users, run the following commands. $ apt-get update $ apt-get install -y make \\ m4 \\ git \\ wget \\ unzip \\ xz-utils \\ curl \\ lsb-core \\ build-essential \\ libreadline-dev \\ ncurses-dev \\ cmake \\ gettext Check if the GCC and cmake on your host are in the right version. See Software requirements for compiling Nebula Graph for the required versions. $ g++ --version $ cmake --version If your GCC and CMake are in the right version, then you are all set. If they are not, follow the sub-steps as follows. Clone the nebula repository to your host. $ git clone -b master https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-common.git Users can use the --branch or -b option to specify the branch to be cloned. For example, for master, run the following command. $ git clone --branch master https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-common.git Make nebula the current working directory. $ cd nebula Run the following commands to install and enable CMake and GCC. // Install CMake. $ ./third-party/install-cmake.sh cmake-install // Enable CMake. $ source cmake-install/bin/enable-cmake.sh // Authorize the write privilege to the opt directory. $ sudo mkdir /opt/vesoft && sudo chmod -R a+w /opt/vesoft // Install GCC.

To install Nebula Graph in a test environment, we recommend that you use any Linux system with kernel version 3.9 or above. Suggested service architecture for test environments \u00b6 Process Suggested number metad (the metadata service process) 1 storaged (the storage service process) 1 or more graphd (the query engine service process) 1 or more For example, for a single-machine test environment, you can deploy 1 metad, 1 storaged, and 1 graphd processes in the machine. For a more common test environment, such as a cluster of 3 machines (named as A, B, and C), you can deploy Nebula Graph as follows: Machine name Number of metad Number of storaged Number of graphd A 1 1 1 B None 1 1 C None 1 1 Requirements and suggestions for installing Nebula Graph in production environments \u00b6 Hardware requirements for production environments \u00b6 Item Requirement CPU architecture x86_64 Number of CPU core 48 Memory 96 GB Disk 2 * 900 GB, NVMe SSD Supported operating systems for production environments \u00b6 For now, we can only install Nebula Graph in the Linux system. To install Nebula Graph in a production environment, we recommend that you use any Linux system with kernel version 3.9 or above. Users can adjust some of the kernel parameters to better accommodate the need for running Nebula Graph. For more information, see kernel configuration . Suggested service architecture for production environments \u00b6 Danger DO NOT deploy a cluster across IDCs. Process Suggested number metad (the metadata service process) 3 storaged (the storage service process) 3 or more graphd (the query engine service process) 3 or more Each metad process automatically creates and maintains a replica of the metadata. Usually, you need to deploy three metad processes and only three. The number of storaged processes does not affect the number of graph space replicas. Users can deploy multiple processes on a single machine. For example, on a cluster of 5 machines (named as A, B, C, D, and E), you can deploy Nebula Graph as follows: Machine name Number of metad Number of storaged Number of graphd A 1 1 1 B 1 1 1 C 1 1 1 D None 1 1 E None 1 1 Capacity requirements for running a Nebula Graph cluster \u00b6 Users can estimate the memory, disk space, and partition number needed for a Nebula Graph cluster of 3 replicas as follows. Resource Unit How to estimate Description Disk space for a cluster Bytes the_sum_of_edge_number_and_vertex_number * average_bytes_of_properties * 6 * 120% - Memory for a cluster Bytes [ the_sum_of_edge_number_and_vertex_number * 15 + the_number_of_RocksDB_instances * ( write_buffer_size * max_write_buffer_number + rocksdb_block_cache )] * 120% write_buffer_size and max_write_buffer_number are RocksDB parameters. For more information, see MemTable . For details about rocksdb_block_cache , see Memory usage in RocksDB . Number of partitions for a graph space - the_number_of_disks_in_the_cluster * disk_partition_num_multiplier disk_partition_num_multiplier is an integer between 2 and 10 (both including). Its value depends on the disk performance. Use 2 for HDD. Question 1: Why do we multiply the disk space and memory by 120%? Answer: The extra 20% is for buffer. Question 2: How to get the number of RocksDB instances? Answer: Each directory in the --data_path item in the etc/nebula-storaged.conf file corresponds to a RocksDB instance. Count the number of directories to get the RocksDB instance number. Note Users can decrease the memory size occupied by the bloom filter by adding --enable_partitioned_index_filter=true in etc/nebula-storaged.conf . But it may decrease the read performance in some random-seek cases. FAQ \u00b6 About storage devices \u00b6 Nebula Graph is designed and implemented for NVMe SSD. All default parameters are optimized for the SSD devices and require extremely high IOPS and low latency. Due to the poor IOPS capability and long random seek latency, HDD is not recommended.

Prerequisites \u00b6 Users have to prepare correct resources described in Prepare resources for compiling, installing, and running Nebula Graph . The host to be installed with Nebula Graph has access to the Internet. Installation steps \u00b6 Note Starting with the Nebula Graph master release, the code repositories for Nebula-Graph, Nebula-Storage, and Nebula-Common have been merged into the Nebula code repository, so the compilation steps are different from those in previous releases. Use Git to clone the source code of Nebula Graph to the host. [Recommended] To install Nebula Graph master, run the following command. $ git clone --branch master https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula.git To install the latest developing release, run the following command to clone the source code from the master branch. $ git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula.git Make the nebula directory the current working directory. $ cd nebula Create a build directory and make it the current working directory. $ mkdir build && cd build Generate Makefile with CMake. Note The installation path is /usr/local/nebula by default. To customize it, add the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_path> CMake variable in the following command. For more information about CMake variables, see CMake variables . $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX = /usr/local/nebula -DENABLE_TESTING = OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release .. Compile Nebula Graph. Note Check Prepare resources for compiling, installing, and running Nebula Graph . To speed up the compiling, use the -j option to set a concurrent number N . It should be \\(\\min(\\text{CPU}core number,\\frac{the_memory_size(GB)}{2})\\) . $ make -j { N } # E.g., make -j2 Install Nebula Graph. $ sudo make install The configuration files in the etc/ directory ( /usr/local/nebula/etc by default) are references. Users can create their own configuration files accordingly. If you want to use the scripts in the script directory to start, stop, restart, and kill the service, and check the service status, the configuration files have to be named as nebula-graph.conf , nebula-metad.conf , and nebula-storaged.conf . Update the master branch \u00b6 The source code of the master branch changes frequently. If the corresponding Nebula Graph release is installed, update it in the following steps. In the nebula directory, run git pull upstream master to update the source code. In the nebula/build directory, run make -j{N} and make install again. Next to do \u00b6 (Enterprise Edition) Deploy license Manage Nebula Graph services CMake variables \u00b6 Usage of CMake variables \u00b6 $ cmake -D<variable> = <value> ... The following CMake variables can be used at the configure (cmake) stage to adjust the compiling settings. CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX \u00b6 CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX specifies the path where the service modules, scripts, configuration files are installed. The default path is /usr/local/nebula . ENABLE_WERROR \u00b6 ENABLE_WERROR is ON by default and it makes all warnings into errors. You can set it to OFF if needed. ENABLE_TESTING \u00b6 ENABLE_TESTING is ON by default and unit tests are built with the Nebula Graph services. If you just need the service modules, set it to OFF . ENABLE_ASAN \u00b6 ENABLE_ASAN is OFF by default and the building of ASan (AddressSanitizer), a memory error detector, is disabled. To enable it, set ENABLE_ASAN to ON . This variable is intended for Nebula Graph developers. CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE \u00b6 Nebula Graph supports the following building types of MAKE_BUILD_TYPE : Debug The default value of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE . It indicates building Nebula Graph with the debug info but not the optimization options. Release It indicates building Nebula Graph with the optimization options but not the debug info. RelWithDebInfo It indicates building Nebula Graph with the optimization options and the debug info. MinSizeRel It indicates building Nebula Graph with the optimization options for controlling the code size but not the debug info. CMAKE_C_COMPILER/CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER \u00b6 Usually, CMake locates and uses a C/C++ compiler installed in the host automatically. But if your compiler is not installed at the standard path, or if you want to use a different one, run the command as follows to specify the installation path of the target compiler: $ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER = <path_to_gcc/bin/gcc> -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER = <path_to_gcc/bin/g++> .. $ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER = <path_to_clang/bin/clang> -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER = <path_to_clang/bin/clang++> .. ENABLE_CCACHE \u00b6 ENABLE_CCACHE is ON by default and Ccache (compiler cache) is used to speed up the compiling of Nebula Graph. To disable ccache , setting ENABLE_CCACHE to OFF is not enough. On some platforms, the ccache installation hooks up or precedes the compiler. In such a case, you have to set an environment variable export CCACHE_DISABLE=true or add a line disable=true in ~/.ccache/ccache.conf as well. For more information, see the ccache official documentation . NEBULA_THIRDPARTY_ROOT \u00b6 NEBULA_THIRDPARTY_ROOT specifies the path where the third party software is installed. By default it is /opt/vesoft/third-party . Examine problems \u00b6 If the compiling fails, we suggest you: Check whether the operating system release meets the requirements and whether the memory and hard disk space are sufficient.

Try this command if you are using the nightly release and having some compatibility issues. Modify configurations \u00b6 The configuration file of Nebula Graph deployed by Docker Compose is nebula-docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml . To make the new configuration take effect, modify the configuration in this file and restart the service. For more instructions, see Configurations . FAQ \u00b6 How to fix the docker mapping to external ports? \u00b6 To set the ports of corresponding services as fixed mapping, modify the docker-compose.yaml in the nebula-docker-compose directory. For example: graphd: image: vesoft/nebula-graphd:master ... ports: - 9669 :9669 - 19669 - 19670 9669:9669 indicates the internal port 9669 is uniformly mapped to external ports, while 19669 indicates the internal port 19669 is randomly mapped to external ports. How to upgrade or update the docker images of Nebula Graph services \u00b6 In the nebula-docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml file, change all the image values to the required image version. In the nebula-docker-compose directory, run docker-compose pull to update the images of the Graph Service, Storage Service, and Meta Service. Note Note that all the Nebula Graph services are stopped before running the command docker-compose pull . Run docker-compose up -d to start the Nebula Graph services again. After connecting to Nebula Graph with Nebula Console, run SHOW HOSTS GRAPH , SHOW HOSTS STORAGE , or SHOW HOSTS META to check the version of the responding service respectively. ERROR: toomanyrequests when docker-compose pull \u00b6 You may meet the following error. ERROR: toomanyrequests: You have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by authenticating and upgrading: https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limit . You have met the rate limit of Docker Hub. Learn more on Understanding Docker Hub Rate Limiting . How to update the Nebula Console client \u00b6 To update the Nebula Console client, run the following command. docker pull vesoft/nebula-console:v2.6.0 Why can\u2019t I connect to Nebula Graph via port 3699 after updating the nebula-docker-compose repository (Nebula Graph 2.0.0-RC)? \u00b6 In Nebula Graph 2.0.0-RC release, the default port is changed from 3699 to 9669 . Please use port 9669 to connect to Nebula Graph, or modify the port in docker-compose.yaml . Why can't I access the data after updating the nebula-docker-compose repository? (Jan 4, 2021) \u00b6 If you have updated the nebula-docker-compose repository after Jan 4, 2021, and there are pre-existing data, modify the docker-compose.yaml file and change the port numbers to the previous ones before connecting to Nebula Graph. Why can't I access the data after updating the nebula-docker-compose repository? (Jan 27, 2021) \u00b6 The data format has been modified on Jan 27, 2021, and is incompatible with the previous data.

Install Nebula Graph with RPM or DEB package Install Nebula Graph by compiling the source code Step 2: Modify the configurations \u00b6 To deploy Nebula Graph according to your requirements, you have to modify the configuration files. All the configuration files for Nebula Graph, including nebula-graphd.conf , nebula-metad.conf , and nebula-storaged.conf , are stored in the etc directory in the installation path. You only need to modify the configuration for the corresponding service on the machines. The configurations that need to be modified for each machine are as follows. Machine name The configuration to be modified A nebula-graphd.conf , nebula-storaged.conf , nebula-metad.conf B nebula-graphd.conf , nebula-storaged.conf , nebula-metad.conf C nebula-graphd.conf , nebula-storaged.conf , nebula-metad.conf D nebula-graphd.conf , nebula-storaged.conf E nebula-graphd.conf , nebula-storaged.conf Users can refer to the content of the following configurations, which only show part of the cluster settings. The hidden content uses the default setting so that users can better understand the relationship between the servers in the Nebula Graph cluster. Note The main configuration to be modified is meta_server_addrs . All configurations need to fill in the IP addresses and ports of all Meta services. At the same time, local_ip needs to be modified as the network IP address of the machine itself.

Descriptions are as follows. Machine name The process to be started A graphd, storaged, metad B graphd, storaged, metad C graphd, storaged, metad D graphd, storaged E graphd, storaged The command to start the Nebula Graph services is as follows. sudo /usr/local/nebula/scripts/nebula.service start <metad | graphd | storaged | all> Note Make sure all the processes of services on each machine are started. Otherwise, you will fail to start Nebula Graph. When the graphd process, the storaged process, and the metad process are all started, you can use all instead. /usr/local/nebula is the default installation path for Nebula Graph. Use the actual path if you have customized the path. For more information about how to start and stop the services, see Manage Nebula Graph services . Step 4: Check the cluster status \u00b6 Install the native CLI client Nebula Console , then connect to any machine that has started the graphd process, and run SHOW HOSTS to check the cluster status. For example: $ ./nebula-console --addr 192 .168.10.111 --port 9669 -u root -p nebula 2021 /05/25 01 :41:19 [ INFO ] connection pool is initialized successfully Welcome to Nebula Graph! > SHOW HOSTS ; +------------------+------+----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------------+ | Host | Port | Status | Leader count | Leader distribution | Partition distribution | +------------------+------+----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------------+ | \"192.168.10.111\" | 9779 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | \"No valid partition\" | \"No valid partition\" | | \"192.168.10.112\" | 9779 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | \"No valid partition\" | \"No valid partition\" | | \"192.168.10.113\" | 9779 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | \"No valid partition\" | \"No valid partition\" | | \"192.168.10.114\" | 9779 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | \"No valid partition\" | \"No valid partition\" | | \"192.168.10.115\" | 9779 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | \"No valid partition\" | \"No valid partition\" | | \"Total\" | | | 0 | | | +------------------+------+----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------------+","title":"Deploy a Nebula Graph cluster on multiple servers"},{"location":"4.deployment-and-installation/2.compile-and-install-nebula-graph/deploy-nebula-graph-cluster/#deploy_a_nebula_graph_cluster_with_rpmdeb_package_on_multiple_servers","text":"For now, Nebula Graph does not provide an official deployment tool.

This topic describes how to upgrade Nebula Graph to vmaster. Note To upgrade Nebula Graph v2.0.0-GA or later versions to vmaster, see Nebula Graph v2.0.x to vmaster . Limitations \u00b6 Rolling Upgrade is not supported. You must stop the Nebula Graph services before the upgrade. There is no upgrade script. You have to manually upgrade each server in the cluster. This topic does not apply to scenarios where Nebula Graph is deployed with Docker, including Docker Swarm, Docker Compose, and K8s. You must upgrade the old Nebula Graph services on the same machines they are deployed. DO NOT change the IP addresses, configuration files of the machines, and DO NOT change the cluster topology. The hard disk space of each machine should be three times as much as the space taken by the original data directories. Known issues that could cause data loss are listed on GitHub known issues . The issues are all related to altering schema or default values. To connect to Nebula Graph 2.0.0, you must upgrade all the Nebula Graph clients. The communication protocols of the old versions and the latest versions are not compatible. The upgrade takes about 30 minutes in this test environment . DO NOT use soft links to switch the data directories. You must have the sudo privileges to complete the steps in this topic. Installation paths \u00b6 Old installation path \u00b6 By default, old versions of Nebula Graph are installed in /usr/local/nebula/ , hereinafter referred to as ${nebula-old} . The default configuration file path is ${nebula-old}/etc/ . Storaged data path is defined by the --data_path option in the ${nebula-old}/etc/nebula-storaged.conf file. The default path is data/storage . Metad data path is defined by the --data_path option in the ${nebula-old}/etc/nebula-metad.conf file. The default path is data/meta . Note The actual paths in your environment may be different from those described in this topic. You can run the Linux command ps -ef | grep nebula to locate them. New installation path \u00b6 ${nebula-new} represents the installation path of the new Nebula Graph version, such as /usr/local/nebula-new/ . # mkdir -p ${nebula-new} Upgrade steps \u00b6 Stop all client connections . You can run the following commands on each Graph server to turn off the Graph Service and avoid dirty write. # ${nebula-old}/scripts/nebula.service stop graphd [INFO] Stopping nebula-graphd... [INFO] Done Run the following commands to stop all services of the old version Nebula Graph. # ${nebula-old}/scripts/nebula.service stop all [INFO] Stopping nebula-metad... [INFO] Done [INFO] Stopping nebula-graphd... [INFO] Done [INFO] Stopping nebula-storaged... [INFO] Done The storaged process needs about 1 minute to flush data. Wait 1 minute and then run ps -ef | grep nebula to check and make sure that all the Nebula Graph services are stopped. Note If the services are not fully stopped in 20 minutes, stop upgrading and go to the Nebula Graph community for help. Install the new version of Nebula Graph on each machine. Install the new binary file. To install with RPM/DEB packages, download the installation package of the corresponding operating system from release page . # sudo rpm --force -i --prefix=${nebula-new} ${nebula-package-name.rpm} # for centos/redhat # sudo dpkg -i --instdir==${nebula-new} ${nebula-package-name.deb} # for ubuntu For detailed steps, see Install Nebula Graph with RPM or DEB package . To install with the source code, follow the substeps. For detailed steps, see Install Nebula Graph by compiling the source code . Some key commands are as follows. Clone the source code. # git clone --branch master https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-graph.git Configure CMake. # cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${nebula-new} -DENABLE_TESTING=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. Copy the configuration files from the old path to the new path. # cp -rf ${nebula-old}/etc ${nebula-new}/ Follow the substeps to prepare the Meta servers (usually 3 of them in a cluster). Locate the old Meta data path and copy the data files to the new path. Find the --data_path option in ${nebula-old}/etc/nebula-metad.conf . The default value is data/meta . If the legacy versions has not changed the --data_path item, run the following command to copy the meta data to the new directory. # mkdir -p ${nebula-new}/data/meta/ # cp -r ${nebula-old}/data/meta/* ${nebula-new}/data/meta/ If the legacy versions change the default metad directory, copy it according to the actual directory. Modify the new Meta configuration files. Edit the new metad configuration file. # vim ${nebula-new}/nebula-metad.conf [Optional]Add the following parameters in the Meta configuration files if you need them. --null_type=false : Disables the support for using NULL . The default value is true . When set to false , you must specify a default value when altering tags or edge types, otherwise, data reading fails. --string_index_limit=32 : Specifies the index length for string values as 32. The default length is 64. Note You must make sure that this step is applied on every Meta server. Prepare the Storage configuration files on each Storage server. [Optional]If the old Storage data path is not the default setting --data_path=data/storage , modify it. # vim ${nebula-new}/nebula-storaged.conf Change the value of --data_path as the new data path. Create the new Storage data directories. # mkdir -p ${nebula-new}/data/storage/ If the --data_path default value has been modified, create the Storage data directories according to the modification. Start the new Meta Service. Run the following command on each Meta server. # ${nebula-new}/scripts/nebula.service start metad [INFO] Starting nebula-metad... [INFO] Done Check if every nebula-metad process is started normally. # ps -ef |grep nebula-metad Check if there is any error information in the Meta logs in ${nebula-new}/logs . Note If any nebula-metad process cannot start normally, stop upgrading, start the Nebula Graph services from the old directories , and take the error logs to the Nebula Graph community for help. Run the following commands to upgrade the Storage data format. # ${nebula-new}/bin/db_upgrader \\ --src_db_path=<old_storage_directory_path> \\ --dst_db_path=<new_storage_directory_path> \\ --upgrade_meta_server=<meta_server_ip1>:<port1>[,<meta_server_ip2>:<port2>,...] \\ --upgrade_version=<old_nebula_version> \\ The parameters are described as follows. --src_db_path : Specifies the absolute path of the OLD Storage data directories. Separate multiple paths with commas, without spaces. --dst_db_path : Specifies the absolute path of the NEW Storage data directories. Separate multiple paths with commas, without spaces. The paths must correspond to the paths set in --src_db_path one by one. --upgrade_meta_server : Specifies the addresses of the new Meta servers that you started in step 6. --upgrade_version : If the old Nebula Graph version is v1.2.0, set the parameter value to 1 . If the old version is v2.0.0-RC1, set the value to 2 . Do not set the value to other numbers. Danger Do not mix up the order of --src_db_path and --dst_db_path . Otherwise, the old data will be damaged during the upgrade. For example, upgrade from v1.2.x: # /usr/local/nebula_new/bin/db_upgrader \\ --src_db_path=/usr/local/nebula/data/storage/data1/,/usr/local/nebula/data/storage/data2/ \\ --dst_db_path=/usr/local/nebula_new/data/storage/data1/,/usr/local/nebula_new/data/storage/data2/\\ --upgrade_meta_server=192.168.*.14:45500,192.168.*.15:45500,192.168.*.16:45500 \\ --upgrade_version=1 For example, upgrade from v2.0.0-RC1: # /usr/local/nebula_new/bin/db_upgrader \\ --src_db_path=/usr/local/nebula/data/storage/ \\ --dst_db_path=/usr/local/nebula_new/data/storage/ \\ --upgrade_meta_server=192.168.*.14:9559,192.168.*.15:9559,192.168.*.16:9559 \\ --upgrade_version=2 Note If anything goes wrong, Stop upgrading, stop all the Meta servers, and start the Nebula Graph services from the old directories. Make sure that all the Storage servers have finished the upgrade. Start the new Storage Service on each Storage server. # ${nebula-new}/scripts/nebula.service start storaged # ${nebula-new}/scripts/nebula.service status storaged Note If this step goes wrong on any server, Take the logs in ${nebula-new}/logs/ to the Nebula Graph community for help. Stop upgrading. Stop all the Meta servers and Storage servers. Start the Nebula Graph services from the old directories. Start the new Graph Service on each Graph server. # ${nebula-new}/scripts/nebula.service start graphd # ${nebula-new}/scripts/nebula.service status graphd Note If this step goes wrong on any server, take the logs in ${nebula-new}/logs/ to the Nebula Graph community for help. Stop upgrading. Stop all the Meta servers, Storage servers, and Graph servers. Start the Nebula Graph services from the old directories. Connect to Nebula Graph with the new versions of Nebula Console . Verify if the Nebula Graph services are available and if the data can be accessed normally. Make sure that the command parameters, including the IP address and port of the Graph Service, are the same as the old one. nebula> SHOW HOSTS; nebula> SHOW SPACES; nebula> USE <space_name> nebula> SHOW PARTS; nebula> SUBMIT JOB STATS; nebula> SHOW STATS; Note The old releases of Nebula Console may have compatibility issues. Upgrade other Nebula Graph clients. You must upgrade all other clients to corresponding Nebula Graph vmaster. The clients include but are not limited to Python , Java , go , C++ , Flink-connector , Algorithm , Exchange , Spark-connector , and Nebula Bench . Find the vmaster branch for each client. Note Communication protocols of vmaster are not compatible with that of the old releases. To upgrade the clients, compile the vmaster source code of the clients or download corresponding binaries. Tip for maintenance: The data path after the upgrade is ${nebula-new}/ . Modify relative paths for hard disk monitor systems, log, or ELK, etc. Upgrade failure and rollback \u00b6 If the upgrade fails, stop all Nebula Graph services of the new version, and start the services of the old version. All Nebula Graph clients in use must be switched to the old version . Appendix 1: Test Environment \u00b6 The test environment for this topic is as follows: Machine specifications: 32 CPU cores, 62 GB memory, and SSD. Data size: 100 GB of Nebula Graph 1.2.0 LDBC test data, with 1 graph space, 24 partitions, and 92 GB of data directory size. Concurrent configuration: --max_concurrent=5 , --max_concurrent_parts=24 , and --write_batch_num=100 . The upgrade cost 21 minutes in all, including 13 minutes of compaction. The descriptions are as follows. Parameter Default value --max_concurrent 5 --max_concurrent_parts 10 --write_batch_num 100 Appendix 2: Nebula Graph V2.0.0 code address and commit ID \u00b6 Code address Commit ID graphd 91639db storaged and metad 761f22b common b2512aa FAQ \u00b6 Can I write through the client during the upgrade? \u00b6 A: No. The state of the data written during this process is undefined. Can I upgrade other old versions except for v1.2.x and v2.0.0-RC to vmaster? \u00b6 A: Upgrading from other old versions is not tested. Theoretically, versions between v1.0.0 and v1.2.0 could adopt the upgrade approach for v1.2.x. v2.0.0-RC nightly versions cannot apply the solutions in this topic. How to upgrade if a machine has only the Graph Service, but not the Storage Service? \u00b6 A: Upgrade the Graph Service with the corresponding binary or rpm package. How to resolve the error Permission denied ? \u00b6 A: Try again with the sudo privileges. Is there any change in gflags? \u00b6 A: Yes. For more information, see github issues . What are the differences between deleting data then installing the new version and upgrading according to this topic? \u00b6 A: The default configurations for v2.x and v1.x are different, including the ports used. The upgrade solution keeps the old configurations, and the delete-and-install solution uses the new configurations. Is there a tool or solution for verifying data consistency after the upgrade? \u00b6 A: No.","title":"Upgrade Nebula Graph to the current version"},{"location":"4.deployment-and-installation/3.upgrade-nebula-graph/upgrade-nebula-graph-to-latest/#upgrade_nebula_graph_to_vmaster","text":"The legacy versions of Nebula Graph refer to the versions lower than Nebula Graph v2.0.0-GA.

Prerequisites \u00b6 You have read and fully understood the restrictions for using full-text indexes. You have deployed a Nebula Graph cluster . You have deploy a Elasticsearch cluster . You have prepared at least one extra Storage Server. To use the full-text search, you must run one or more Storage Server as the Raft Listener. Precautions \u00b6 The Storage Service that you want to run as the Listener must have the same or later release with all the other Nebula Graph services in the cluster. For now, you can only add all Listeners to a graph space once and for all. Trying to add a new Listener to a graph space that already has a Listener will fail. To add all Listeners, set them in one statement . Deployment process \u00b6 Step 1: Install the Storage service \u00b6 The Listener process and the storaged process use the same binary file. However, their configuration files and using ports are different. You can install Nebula Graph on all servers that need to deploy a Listener, but only the Storage service can be used. For details, see Install Nebula Graph by RPM or DEB Package . Step 2: Prepare the configuration file for the Listener \u00b6 You have to prepare a corresponding configuration file on the machine that you want to deploy a Listener. The file must be named as nebula-storaged-listener.conf and stored in the etc directory. A template is provided for your reference. Note that the file suffix .production should be removed. Most configurations are the same as the configurations of Storage Service . This topic only introduces the differences.

Most configurations are flags. When the Nebula Graph service starts, it will get the configuration information from Configuration files by default. Configurations that are not in the file apply the default values. Note Because there are many configurations and they may change as Nebula Graph develops, this topic will not introduce all configurations. To get detailed descriptions of configurations, follow the instructions below. It is not recommended to modify the configurations that are not introduced in this topic, unless you are familiar with the source code and fully understand the function of configurations. Legacy version compatibility In the topic of 1.x, we provide a method of using the CONFIGS command to modify the configurations in the cache. However, using this method in a production environment can easily cause inconsistencies of configurations between clusters and the local. Therefore, this method will no longer be introduced in the topic of 2.x. Get the configuration list and descriptions \u00b6 Use the following command to get all the configuration information of the service corresponding to the binary file: <binary> --help For example: # Get the help information from Meta $ /usr/local/nebula/bin/nebula-metad --help # Get the help information from Graph $ /usr/local/nebula/bin/nebula-graphd --help # Get the help information from Storage $ /usr/local/nebula/bin/nebula-storaged --help The above examples use the default storage path /usr/local/nebula/bin/ . If you modify the installation path of Nebula Graph, use the actual path to query the configurations. Get configurations \u00b6 Use the curl command to get the value of the running configurations. Legacy version compatibility The curl commands and parameters in Nebula Graph v2.x. are different from Nebula Graph v1.x. For example: # Get the running configurations from Meta curl 127 .0.0.1:19559/flags # Get the running configurations from Graph curl 127 .0.0.1:19669/flags # Get the running configurations from Storage curl 127 .0.0.1:19779/flags Note In an actual environment, use the real host IP address instead of 127.0.0.1 in the above example. Configuration files \u00b6 Nebula Graph provides two initial configuration files for each service, <service_name>.conf.default and <service_name>.conf.production . Users can use them in different scenarios conveniently. The default path is /usr/local/nebula/etc/ . The configuration values in the initial configuration file are for reference only and can be adjusted according to actual needs. To use the initial configuration file, choose one of the above two files and delete the suffix .default or .production to make it valid. Caution To ensure the availability of services, the configurations of the same service must be consistent, except for the local IP address local_ip . For example, three Storage servers are deployed in one Nebula Graph cluster. The configurations of the three Storage servers need to be the same, except for the IP address. The initial configuration files corresponding to each service are as follows. Nebula Graph service Initial configuration file Description Meta nebula-metad.conf.default and nebula-metad.conf.production Meta service configuration Graph nebula-graphd.conf.default and nebula-graphd.conf.production Graph service configuration Storage nebula-storaged.conf.default and nebula-storaged.conf.production Storage service configuration Each initial configuration file of all services contains local_config . The default value is true , which means that the Nebula Graph service will get configurations from its configuration files and start it. Caution It is not recommended to modify the value of local_config to false . If modified, the Nebula Graph service will first read the cached configurations, which may cause configuration inconsistencies between clusters and cause unknown risks. Modify configurations \u00b6 By default, each Nebula Graph service gets configurations from its configuration files.

Users can use them in different scenarios conveniently. The default file path is /usr/local/nebula/etc/ . Caution It is not recommended to modify the value of local_config to false . If modified, the Nebula Graph service will first read the cached configurations, which may cause configuration inconsistencies between clusters and cause unknown risks. It is not recommended to modify the configurations that are not introduced in this topic, unless you are familiar with the source code and fully understand the function of configurations. How to use the configuration files \u00b6 To use the initial configuration file, choose one of the above two files and delete the suffix .default or .production from the initial configuration file for the Meta Service to apply the configurations defined in it. About parameter values \u00b6 If a parameter is not set in the configuration file, Nebula Graph uses the default value. Not all parameters are predefined. And the predefined parameters in the two initial configuration files are different. This topic uses the parameters in nebula-metad.conf.default . For parameters that are not included in nebula-metad.conf.default , see nebula-storaged.conf.production . Note The configurations of the Raft Listener and the Storage service are different. For details, see Deploy Raft listener . For all parameters and their current values, see Configurations . Basics configurations \u00b6 Name Predefined value Description daemonize true When set to true , the process is a daemon process. pid_file pids/nebula-storaged.pid The file that records the process ID. timezone_name - Specifies the Nebula Graph time zone. This parameter is not predefined in the initial configuration files. The system default value is UTC+00:00:00 . For the format of the parameter value, see Specifying the Time Zone with TZ . For example, --timezone_name=UTC+08:00 represents the GMT+8 time zone. local_config true When set to true , the process gets configurations from the configuration files. Note While inserting property values of time types , Nebula Graph transforms time types (except TIMESTAMP) to the corresponding UTC according to the time zone specified by timezone_name . The time-type values returned by nGQL queries are all UTC. timezone_name is only used to transform the data stored in Nebula Graph. Other time-related data of the Nebula Graph processes still uses the default time zone of the host, such as the log printing time. Logging configurations \u00b6 Name Predefined value Description log_dir logs The directory that stores the Meta Service log. It is recommended to put logs on a different hard disk from the data. minloglevel 0 Specifies the minimum level of the log. That is, no logs below this level will be printed. Optional values are 0 (INFO), 1 (WARNING), 2 (ERROR), 3 (FATAL). It is recommended to set it to 0 during debugging and 1 in a production environment. If it is set to 4 , Nebula Graph will not print any logs. v 0 Specifies the detailed level of the log. The larger the value, the more detailed the log is. Optional values are 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 . logbufsecs 0 Specifies the maximum time to buffer the logs. If there is a timeout, it will output the buffered log to the log file. 0 means real-time output. This configuration is measured in seconds. redirect_stdout true When set to true , the process redirects the stdout and stderr to separate output files. stdout_log_file graphd-stdout.log Specifies the filename for the stdout log. stderr_log_file graphd-stderr.log Specifies the filename for the stderr log. stderrthreshold 2 Specifies the minloglevel to be copied to the stderr log.

Multiple addresses are separated with commas. local_ip 127.0.0.1 Specifies the local IP for the Storage Service. The local IP address is used to identify the nebula-storaged process. If it is a distributed cluster or requires remote access, modify it to the corresponding address. port 9779 Specifies RPC daemon listening port of the Storage service. The external port for the Meta Service is predefined to 9779 . The internal port is predefined to 9777 , 9778 , and 9780 . Nebula Graph uses the internal port for multi-replica interactions. ws_ip 0.0.0.0 Specifies the IP address for the HTTP service. ws_http_port 19779 Specifies the port for the HTTP service. ws_h2_port 19780 Specifies the port for the HTTP2 service. heartbeat_interval_secs 10 Specifies the default heartbeat interval. Make sure the heartbeat_interval_secs values for all services are the same, otherwise Nebula Graph CANNOT work normally. This configuration is measured in seconds. Caution The real IP address must be used in the configuration file. Otherwise, 127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0 cannot be parsed correctly in some cases. Raft configurations \u00b6 Name Predefined value Description raft_heartbeat_interval_secs 30 Specifies the time to expire the Raft election. The configuration is measured in seconds. raft_rpc_timeout_ms 500 Specifies the time to expire the Raft RPC.

Optional values are no , snappy , lz4 , lz4hc , zlib , bzip2 , and zstd . rocksdb_compression_per_level \\ Specifies the compression algorithm for each level. enable_rocksdb_statistics false When set to false , RocksDB statistics is disabled. rocksdb_stats_level kExceptHistogramOrTimers Specifies the stats level for RocksDB. Optional values are kExceptHistogramOrTimers , kExceptTimers , kExceptDetailedTimers , kExceptTimeForMutex , and kAll . enable_rocksdb_prefix_filtering true When set to true , the prefix bloom filter for RocksDB is enabled. Enabling prefix bloom filter makes the graph traversal faster but occupies more memory. enable_rocksdb_whole_key_filtering false When set to true , the whole key bloom filter for RocksDB is enabled. rocksdb_filtering_prefix_length 12 Specifies the prefix length for each key. Optional values are 12 and 16 . The configuration is measured in bytes. enable_partitioned_index_filter - When set to true , it reduces the amount of memory used by the bloom filter. But in some random-seek situations, it may reduce the read performance. misc configurations \u00b6 Caution The configuration snapshot in the following table is different from the snapshot in Nebula Graph. The snapshot here refers to the stock data on the leader when synchronizing Raft.

Resource control \u00b6 ulimit precautions \u00b6 The ulimit command specifies the resource threshold for the current shell session. The precautions are as follows: The changes made by ulimit only take effect for the current session or child process. The resource threshold (soft threshold) cannot exceed the hard threshold. Common users cannot use commands to adjust the hard threshold, even with sudo . To modify the system level or adjust the hard threshold, edit the file /etc/security/limits.conf . This method requires re-login to take effect. ulimit -c \u00b6 ulimit -c limits the size of the core dumps. We recommend that you set it to unlimited . The command is: ulimit -c unlimited ulimit -n \u00b6 ulimit -n limits the number of open files. We recommend that you set it to more than 100,000. For example: ulimit -n 130000 Memory \u00b6 vm.swappiness \u00b6 vm.swappiness specifies the percentage of the available memory before starting swap. The greater the value, the more likely the swap occurs. We recommend that you set it to 0. When set to 0, the page cache is removed first. Note that when vm.swappiness is 0, it does not mean that there is no swap. vm.min_free_kbytes \u00b6 vm.min_free_kbytes specifies the minimum number of kilobytes available kept by Linux VM. If you have a large system memory, we recommend that you increase this value. For example, if your physical memory 128GB, set it to 5GB. If the value is not big enough, the system cannot apply for enough continuous physical memory. vm.max_map_count \u00b6 vm.max_map_count limits the maximum number of vma (virtual memory area) for a process. The default value is 65530 . It is enough for most applications. If your memory application fails because the memory consumption is large, increase the vm.max_map_count value. vm.dirty_* \u00b6 These values control the dirty data cache for the system. For write-intensive scenarios, you can make adjustments based on your needs (throughput priority or delay priority). We recommend that you use the system default value. Transparent huge page \u00b6 For better delay performance, you must disable the transparent huge pages (THP). The command is: root# echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled root# echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag root# swapoff -a && swapon -a Networking \u00b6 net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle \u00b6 The default value of net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle is 1 . If set, the congestion window is timed out after an idle period. We recommend that you set it to 0 , especially for long fat scenarios (high latency and large bandwidth). net.core.somaxconn \u00b6 net.core.somaxconn specifies the maximum number of connection queues listened by the socket. The default value is 128 . For scenarios with a large number of burst connections, we recommend that you set it to greater than 1024 . net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog \u00b6 net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog specifies the maximum number of TCP connections in the SYN_RECV (semi-connected) state. The setting rule for this parameter is the same as that of net.core.somaxconn . net.core.netdev_max_backlog \u00b6 net.core.netdev_max_backlog specifies the maximum number of packets. The default value is 1000 . We recommend that you increase it to greater than 10,000 , especially for 10G network adapters. net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_* \u00b6 These values keep parameters alive for TCP connections. For applications that use a 4-layer transparent load balancer, if the idle connection is disconnected unexpectedly, decrease the values of tcp_keepalive_time and tcp_keepalive_intvl . net.ipv4.tcp_rmem/wmem \u00b6 net.ipv4.tcp_wmem/rmem specifies the minimum, default, and maximum size of the buffer pool sent/received by the TCP socket. For long fat links, we recommend that you increase the default value to bandwidth (GB) * RTT (ms) . scheduler \u00b6 For SSD devices, we recommend that you set scheduler to noop or none . The path is /sys/block/DEV_NAME/queue/scheduler . Other parameters \u00b6 kernel.core_pattern \u00b6 we recommend that you set it to core and set kernel.core_uses_pid to 1 . Modify parameters \u00b6 sysctl \u00b6 sysctl <conf_name> Checks the current parameter value. sysctl -w <conf_name>=<value> Modifies the parameter value. The modification takes effect immediately. The original value is restored after restarting. sysctl -p [<file_path>] Loads Linux parameter values \u200b\u200bfrom the specified configuration file. The default path is /etc/sysctl.conf . prlimit \u00b6 The prlimit command gets and sets process resource limits. You can modify the hard threshold by using it and the sudo command. For example, prlimit --nofile = 130000 --pid = $$ adjusts the maximum number of open files permitted by the current process to 14000 . And the modification takes effect immediately. Note that this command is only available in RedHat 7u or higher versions.","title":"Kernel configurations"},{"location":"5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/6.kernel-config/#kernel_configurations","text":"This topic introduces the Kernel configurations in Nebula Graph.","title":"Kernel configurations"},{"location":"5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/6.kernel-config/#resource_control","text":"","title":"Resource control"},{"location":"5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/6.kernel-config/#ulimit_precautions","text":"The ulimit command specifies the resource threshold for the current shell session.

This topic describes how to enable SSL encryption. Precaution \u00b6 Enabling SSL encryption will slightly affect the performance, such as causing operation latency. Parameters \u00b6 Parameter Default value Description cert_path - The path to the PEM certification. key_path - The path to the key certification. password_path - The path to the password file certification. ca_path - The path to the trusted CA file. enable_ssl false Whether to enable SSL encryption. enable_graph_ssl false Whether to enable SSL encryption in the Graph service only. enable_meta_ssl false Whether to enable SSL encryption in the Meta service only. Certificate modes \u00b6 To use SSL encryption, SSL certificates are required. Nebula Graph supports two certificate modes. Self-signed certificate mode In this mode, users need to make the signed certificate by themselves and set cert_path , key_path , and password_path in the corresponding file according to encryption policies. CA-signed certificate mode In this mode, users need to apply for the signed certificate from a certificate authority and set cert_path , key_path , and password_path in the corresponding file according to encryption policies. Encryption policies \u00b6 Nebula Graph supports three encryption policies. For details, see Usage explanation . Encrypt the data transmission between clients, the Graph service, the Meta service, and the Storage service. Add enable_ssl = true to the configuration files of nebula-graphd.conf , nebula-metad.conf , and nebula-storaged.conf . Encrypt the data transmission between clients and the Graph service. This policy applies to the case that the clusters are set in the same server room. Only the port of the Graph service is open to the outside because other services can communicate over the internal network without encryption. Add enable_graph_ssl = true to the configuration file of nebula-graphd.conf . Encrypt the data transmission related to the Meta service in the cluster.

Background \u00b6 Storage nodes can be added into a Zone, and multiple Zones form a Group. If you specify a Group when creating a space, the space will be created and stored on the Storage nodes within the Group. Data partitions and replicas are stored evenly in each Zone as shown below. Suppose that 8 Storage nodes are divided into 4 Zones, with each one having 2 Storage nodes, and then add Zone1, Zone2, and Zone3 into Group1, add Zone3 and Zone4 into Group2. After specifying Group1 when you create a space called S1, data partitions and replicas will be stored evenly on the nodes in Zone1, Zone2, and Zone3, and will not be stored on the node in Zone4. After specifying Group2 when you create another space called S2, data partitions and replicas will be stored evenly on the nodes in Zone3 and Zone4, and will not be stored on the nodes in Zone1 and Zone2. The above example briefly introduces the zone feature. Users can isolate resources by balanced planning of Zones and Groups. Scenarios \u00b6 Create a space on specified Storage nodes to isolate resources. Perform rolling upgrade of a cluster which requires stopping one or more nodes before the cluster is upgraded, and then restart the nodes until all services on the nodes in the cluster are updated to the latest version.

Replicas can be restored in a Zone, and only one replica of the same partition can exist in a Zone. Many Zones can form a Group for easy management and resource isolation. A Zone can be added into multiple Groups. If you specify a Group when creating a space, replicas in the space will be distributed evenly in each Zone within the Group.

Note The following suggestions may not apply to some special scenarios. In these cases, find help in the Nebula Graph community . Model for performance \u00b6 There is no perfect method to model in Nebula Graph. Graph modeling depends on the questions that you want to know from the data. Your data drives your graph model. Graph data modeling is intuitive and convenient. Create your data model based on your business model. Test your model and gradually optimize it to fit your business. To get better performance, you can change or re-design your model multiple times. Design and evaluate the most important queries \u00b6 Usually, various types of queries are validated in test scenarios to assess the overall capabilities of the system. However, in most production scenarios, there are not many types of frequently used queries. You can optimize the data model based on key queries selected according to the Pareto (80/20) principle. No predefined bonds between Tags and Edge types \u00b6 Define the bonds between Tags and Edge types in the application, not Nebula Graph. There are no statements that could get the bonds between Tags and Edge types. Tags/Edge types predefine a set of properties \u00b6 While creating Tags or Edge types, you need to define a set of properties. Properties are part of the Nebula Graph Schema. Control changes in the business model and the data model \u00b6 Changes here refer to changes in business models and data models (meta-information), not changes in the data itself. Some graph databases are designed to be Schema-free, so their data modeling, including the modeling of the graph topology and properties, can be very flexible. Properties can be re-modeled to graph topology, and vice versa. Such systems are often specifically optimized for graph topology access. Nebula Graph master is a strong-Schema (row storage) system, which means that the business model should not change frequently. For example, the property Schema should not change. It is similar to avoiding ALTER TABLE in MySQL. On the contrary, vertices and their edges can be added or deleted at low costs. Thus, the easy-to-change part of the business model should be transformed to vertices or edges, rather than properties. For example, in a business model, people have relatively fixed properties such as age, gender, and name. But their contact, place of visit, trade account, and login device are often changing. The former is suitable for modeling as properties and the latter as vertices or edges. Breadth-first traversal over depth-first traversal \u00b6 Nebula Graph has lower performance for depth-first traversal based on the Graph topology, and better performance for breadth-first traversal and obtaining properties. For example, if model A contains properties \"name\", \"age\", and \"eye color\", it is recommended to create a tag person and add properties name , age , and eye_color to it. If you create a tag eye_color and an edge type has , and then create an edge to represent the eye color owned by the person, the traversal performance will not be high. The performance of finding an edge by an edge property is close to that of finding a vertex by a vertex property. For some databases, it is recommended to re-model edge properties as those of the intermediate vertices. For example, model the pattern (src)-[edge {P1, P2}]->(dst) as (src)-[edge1]->(i_node {P1, P2})-[edge2]->(dst) . With Nebula Graph master, you can use (src)-[edge {P1, P2}]->(dst) directly to decrease the depth of the traversal and increase the performance. Edge directions \u00b6 To query in the opposite direction of an edge, use the following syntax: (dst)<-[edge]-(src) or GO FROM dst REVERSELY . If you do not care about the directions or want to query against both directions, use the following syntax: (src)-[edge]-(dst) or GO FROM src BIDIRECT . Therefore, there is no need to insert the same edge redundantly in the reversed direction. Set tag properties appropriately \u00b6 Put a group of properties that are on the same level into the same tag. Different groups represent different concepts. Use indexes correctly \u00b6 Using property indexes helps find VIDs through properties, but can lead to performance reduction by 90% or even more. Only use an index when you need to find vertices or edges through their properties. Design VIDs appropriately \u00b6 See VID . Long texts \u00b6 Do not use long texts to create edge properties. Edge properties are stored twice and long texts lead to greater write amplification. For how edges properties are stored, see Storage architecture . It is recommended to store long texts in HBase or Elasticsearch and store its address in Nebula Graph. Dynamic graphs (sequence graphs) are not supported \u00b6 In some scenarios, graphs need to have the time information to describe how the structure of the entire graph changes over time. 1 The Rank field on Edges in Nebula Graph master can be used to store time in int64, but no field on vertices can do this because if you store the time information as property values, it will be covered by new insertion. Thus Nebula Graph does not support sequence graphs. https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2021/temporal-graph-networks \u21a9","title":"Modeling suggestions"},{"location":"8.service-tuning/2.graph-modeling/#graph_data_modeling_suggestions","text":"This topic provides general suggestions for modeling data in Nebula Graph.

In such scenarios, the whole graph is huge, containing maybe trillions of vertices or edges, but the subgraphs accessed by each request are not large (containing millions of vertices or edges), and the latency of a single request is low. The concurrent number of such requests, i.e., the QPS, can be huge. On the other hand, in interactive analysis scenarios, the request concurrency is usually not high, but the subgraphs accessed by each request are large, with thousands of millions of vertices or edges. To lower the latency of big requests in such scenarios, you can split big requests into multiple small requests in the application, and concurrently send them to multiple graphd processes. This can decrease the memory used by each graphd process as well. Besides, you can use Nebula Algorithm for such scenarios. Horizontal or vertical scaling \u00b6 Nebula Graph master supports horizontal scaling. The horizontal scaling of the Storaged process: - Increasing the number of machines deployed with the Storaged process can increase the overall capability of the cluster linearly, including increasing the overall QPS and reducing latency. - However, the number of partitions is fixed when creating a graph space. The service capability of a single partition is determined by a single server. The operations depending on a single partition include fetching properties of a single vertex ( FETCH ), a breadth-first traversal from a single vertex ( GO ), etc. The horizontal scaling of the Graphd process: - Each request from the client is handled by one and only one Graphd process, with no other Graphd processes participating in the processing of the request. - Therefore, increasing the number of machines deployed with the Graphd process can increase the overall QPS of the cluster, but cannot lower the latency of a single request. Metad does not support horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling usually has higher hardware costs, but relatively simple operations. Nebula Graph master can also be scaled vertically.

In Nebula Graph, Compaction is the most important background process and has an important effect on performance. Compaction reads the data that is written on the hard disk, then re-organizes the data structure and the indexes, and then writes back to the hard disk. The read performance can increase by times after compaction. Thus, to get high read performance, trigger compaction (full compaction ) manually when writing a large amount of data into Nebula Graph. Note Note that compaction leads to long-time hard disk IO. We suggest that users do compaction during off-peak hours (for example, early morning). Nebula Graph has two types of compaction : automatic compaction and full compaction . Automatic compaction \u00b6 Automatic compaction is automatically triggered when the system reads data, writes data, or the system restarts. The read performance can increase in a short time. Automatic compaction is enabled by default. But once triggered during peak hours, it can cause unexpected IO occupancy that has an unwanted effect on the performance. Full compaction \u00b6 Full compaction enables large-scale background operations for a graph space such as merging files, deleting the data expired by TTL. This operation needs to be initiated manually. Use the following statements to enable full compaction : Note We recommend you to do the full compaction during off-peak hours because full compaction has a lot of IO operations. nebula> USE <your_graph_space>; nebula> SUBMIT JOB COMPACT; The preceding statement returns the job ID. To show the compaction progress, use the following statement: nebula> SHOW JOB <job_id>; Operation suggestions \u00b6 These are some operation suggestions to keep Nebula Graph performing well. After data import is done, run SUBMIT JOB COMPACT . Run SUBMIT JOB COMPACT periodically during off-peak hours (e.g. early morning).

The edges can be outgoing or incoming. Super vertices are very common because of the power-law distribution. For example, popular leaders in social networks (Internet celebrities), top stocks in the stock market, Big Four in the banking system, hubs in transportation networks, websites with high clicking rates on the Internet, and best sellers in E-commerce. In Nebula Graph master, a vertex and its properties form a key-value pair , with its VID and other meta information as the key . Its Out-Edge Key-Value and In-Edge Key-Value are stored in the same partition in the form of LSM-trees in hard disks and caches. Therefore, directed traversals from this vertex and directed traversals ending at this vertex both involve either a large number of sequential IO scans (ideally, after Compaction or a large number of random IO (frequent writes to the vertex and its ingoing and outgoing edges ). As a rule of thumb, a vertex is considered dense when the number of its edges exceeds 10,000. Some special cases require additional consideration\u3002 Note In Nebula Graph master, there is not any data structure to store the out/in degree for each vertex. Therefore, there is no direct method to know whether it is a super vertex or not. You can try to use Spark to count the degrees periodically. Indexes for duplicate properties \u00b6 In a property graph, there is another class of cases similar to super vertices: a property has a very high duplication rate , i.e., many vertices with the same tag but different VIDs have identical property and property values. Property indexes in Nebula Graph master are designed to reuse the functionality of RocksDB in the Storage Service, in which case indexes are modeled as keys with the same prefix . If the lookup of a property fails to hit the cache, it is processed as a random seek and a sequential prefix scan on the hard disk to find the corresponding VID. After that, the graph is usually traversed from this vertex, so that another random read and sequential scan for the corresponding key-value of this vertex will be triggered. The higher the duplication rate, the larger the scan range. For more information about property indexes, see How indexing works in Nebula Graph . Usually, special design and processing are required when the number of duplicate property values exceeds 10,000. Suggested solutions \u00b6 Solutions at the database end \u00b6 Truncation : Only return a certain number (a threshold) of edges, and do not return other edges exceeding this threshold. Compact : Reorganize the order of data in RocksDB to reduce random reads and increase sequential reads. Solutions at the application end \u00b6 Break up some of the super vertices according to their business significance: Delete multiple edges and merge them into one. For example, in the transfer scenario (Account_A)-[TRANSFER]->(Account_B) , each transfer record is modeled as an edge between account A and account B, then there may be tens of thousands of transfer records between (Account_A) and (Account_B) . In such scenarios, merge obsolete transfer details on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. That is, batch-delete old edges and replace them with a small number of edges representing monthly total and times . And keep the transfer details of the latest month. Split an edge into multiple edges of different types. For example, in the (Airport)<-[DEPART]-(Flight) scenario, the departure of each flight is modeled as an edge between a flight and an airport. Departures from a big airport might be enormous. According to different airlines, divide the DEPART edge type into finer edge types, such as DEPART_CEAIR , DEPART_CSAIR , etc. Specify the departing airline in queries (graph traversal). Split vertices. For example, in the loan network (person)-[BORROW]->(bank) , large bank A will have a very large number of loans and borrowers.

The edges can be outgoing or incoming. Super vertices are very common because of the power-law distribution. For example, popular leaders in social networks (Internet celebrities), top stocks in the stock market, Big Four in the banking system, hubs in transportation networks, websites with high clicking rates on the Internet, and best sellers in E-commerce. In Nebula Graph master, a vertex and its properties form a key-value pair , with its VID and other meta information as the key . Its Out-Edge Key-Value and In-Edge Key-Value are stored in the same partition in the form of LSM-trees in hard disks and caches. Therefore, directed traversals from this vertex and directed traversals ending at this vertex both involve either a large number of sequential IO scans (ideally, after Compaction or a large number of random IO (frequent writes to the vertex and its ingoing and outgoing edges ). As a rule of thumb, a vertex is considered dense when the number of its edges exceeds 10,000. Some special cases require additional consideration\u3002 Note In Nebula Graph master, there is not any data structure to store the out/in degree for each vertex. Therefore, there is no direct method to know whether it is a super vertex or not. You can try to use Spark to count the degrees periodically.","title":"Principle introduction"},{"location":"8.service-tuning/super-node/#indexes_for_duplicate_properties","text":"In a property graph, there is another class of cases similar to super vertices: a property has a very high duplication rate , i.e., many vertices with the same tag but different VIDs have identical property and property values. Property indexes in Nebula Graph master are designed to reuse the functionality of RocksDB in the Storage Service, in which case indexes are modeled as keys with the same prefix . If the lookup of a property fails to hit the cache, it is processed as a random seek and a sequential prefix scan on the hard disk to find the corresponding VID. After that, the graph is usually traversed from this vertex, so that another random read and sequential scan for the corresponding key-value of this vertex will be triggered. The higher the duplication rate, the larger the scan range. For more information about property indexes, see How indexing works in Nebula Graph . Usually, special design and processing are required when the number of duplicate property values exceeds 10,000.","title":"Indexes for duplicate properties"},{"location":"8.service-tuning/super-node/#suggested_solutions","text":"","title":"Suggested solutions"},{"location":"8.service-tuning/super-node/#solutions_at_the_database_end","text":"Truncation : Only return a certain number (a threshold) of edges, and do not return other edges exceeding this threshold.

For example, in the transfer scenario (Account_A)-[TRANSFER]->(Account_B) , each transfer record is modeled as an edge between account A and account B, then there may be tens of thousands of transfer records between (Account_A) and (Account_B) . In such scenarios, merge obsolete transfer details on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. That is, batch-delete old edges and replace them with a small number of edges representing monthly total and times . And keep the transfer details of the latest month. Split an edge into multiple edges of different types. For example, in the (Airport)<-[DEPART]-(Flight) scenario, the departure of each flight is modeled as an edge between a flight and an airport. Departures from a big airport might be enormous. According to different airlines, divide the DEPART edge type into finer edge types, such as DEPART_CEAIR , DEPART_CSAIR , etc. Specify the departing airline in queries (graph traversal). Split vertices. For example, in the loan network (person)-[BORROW]->(bank) , large bank A will have a very large number of loans and borrowers. In such scenarios, you can split the large vertex A into connected sub-vertices A1, A2, and A3. (Person1)-[BORROW]->(BankA1), (Person2)-[BORROW]->(BankA2), (Person2)-[BORROW]->(BankA3); (BankA1)-[BELONGS_TO]->(BankA), (BankA2)-[BELONGS_TO]->(BankA), (BankA3)-[BELONGS_TO]->(BankA).

You can use the search box in the help center or the search function of the browser to match the questions you are looking for. \"What are Cluster, Node, and Service?\" \u00b6 Cluster: refers to a group of systems composed of nodes where multiple Nebula Graph services are located. Node: refers to the physical or virtual machine hosting Nebula Graph services. Service: refers to Nebula services, including Metad, Storaged, and Graphd services. \"What is the cluster status?\" \u00b6 The status of a cluster is as follows: installing: The cluster is being created. The process will take about 3 to 10 minutes. healthy: All services in the cluster are healthy. unhealthy: There is an unhealthy service in the cluster service. \"Why authorizing nodes?\" \u00b6 Managing clusters requires the SSH information of the corresponding node. Therefore, you need to have at least an SSH account and the corresponding password with executable permissions before performing operations on Dashboard. \"What is scaling?\" \u00b6 Nebula Graph is a distributed graph database that supports dynamic scaling services at runtime. Therefore, you can dynamically scale Storaged and Graphd services through Dashboard. The Metad service cannot be scaled. \"Why cannot operate on the Metad service?\" \u00b6 The Metad service stores the metadata of the Nebula Graph database. Once the Metad service fails to function, the entire cluster may break down. Besides, the amount of data processed by the Metad service is not much, so it is not recommended to scale the Metad service. And we directly disabled operating on the Metad service in Dashboard to prevent the cluster from being unavailable due to the misoperation of users. \"What impact will the scaling have on the data?\" \u00b6 Scale out the Storaged service: Dashboard will create and start the Storaged service on the specified machine, which will not affect the existing data. You can choose to perform Balance Data on the Service information page or Balance Leader on the Leader page according to your own needs. Scale in the Storaged service: Dashboard will automatically execute Balance Data Remove to ensure that the service is stopped after the data partition on the specified service is successfully migrated. Scaling the Graphd service will not affect the data. \"Why Dashboard Enterprise Edition cannot be started?\" \u00b6 Make sure that the license file is copied to the Dashboard directory and sudo ./dashboard.service start all is executed. Make sure that the license is not expired. You can also execute cat logs/webserver.log in the Dashboard directory to view the startup information of each module. If the above conditions are met but Dashboard still cannot be started, go to Nebula Graph Official Forum for consultation. \"Can I add the Nebula Graph installation package manually?\" \u00b6 You can add the installation package manually in Dashboard. To download the system and RPM/DEB package you need, see How to download Nebula Graph and add the package to dashboard/download/nebula-graph . And you can select the added package for deployment when creating and scaling out a cluster.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"nebula-dashboard-ent/8.faq/#faq","text":"This topic lists the frequently asked questions for using Nebula Dashboard.

For more information, see Limitations . How to correct the messy code when importing Hive data into Nebula Graph? \u00b6 It may happen if the property value of the data in Hive contains Chinese characters. The solution is to add the following options before the JAR package path in the import command: --conf spark.driver.extraJavaOptions = -Dfile.encoding = utf-8 --conf spark.executor.extraJavaOptions = -Dfile.encoding = utf-8 Namely: <spark_install_path>/bin/spark-submit --master \"local\" \\ --conf spark.driver.extraJavaOptions = -Dfile.encoding = utf-8 \\ --conf spark.executor.extraJavaOptions = -Dfile.encoding = utf-8 \\ --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange \\ <nebula-exchange-2.x.y.jar_path> -c <application.conf_path> In YARN, use the following command: <spark_install_path>/bin/spark-submit \\ --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange \\ --master yarn-cluster \\ --files <application.conf_path> \\ --conf spark.driver.extraClassPath = ./ \\ --conf spark.executor.extraClassPath = ./ \\ --conf spark.driver.extraJavaOptions = -Dfile.encoding = utf-8 \\ --conf spark.executor.extraJavaOptions = -Dfile.encoding = utf-8 \\ <nebula-exchange-2.x.y.jar_path> \\ -c application.conf Configuration \u00b6 Which configuration fields will affect import performance? \u00b6 batch: The number of data contained in each nGQL statement sent to the Nebula Graph service. partition: The number of Spark data partitions, indicating the number of concurrent data imports. nebula.rate: Get a token from the token bucket before sending a request to Nebula Graph. - limit: Represents the size of the token bucket. - timeout: Represents the timeout period for obtaining the token. The values of these four parameters can be adjusted appropriately according to the machine performance. If the leader of the Storage service changes during the import process, you can adjust the values of these four parameters to reduce the import speed. Others \u00b6 Which versions of Nebula Graph are supported by Exchange? \u00b6 See Limitations . What is the relationship between Exchange and Spark Writer? \u00b6 Exchange is the Spark application developed based on Spark Writer. Both are suitable for bulk migration of cluster data to Nebula Graph in a distributed environment, but later maintenance work will be focused on Exchange. Compared with Spark Writer, Exchange has the following improvements: It supports more abundant data sources, such as MySQL, Neo4j, Hive, HBase, Kafka, Pulsar, etc. It fixed some problems of Spark Writer. For example, when Spark reads data from HDFS, the default source data is String, which may be different from the Nebula Graph's Schema. So Exchange adds automatic data type matching and type conversion. When the data type in the Nebula Graph's Schema is non-String (e.g. double), Exchange converts the source data of String type to the corresponding type.","title":"Exchange FAQ"},{"location":"nebula-exchange/ex-ug-FAQ/#exchange_faq","text":"","title":"Exchange FAQ"},{"location":"nebula-exchange/ex-ug-FAQ/#compilation","text":"","title":"Compilation"},{"location":"nebula-exchange/ex-ug-FAQ/#some_packages_not_in_central_repository_failed_to_download_error_could_not_resolve_dependencies_for_project_xxx","text":"Please check the mirror part of Maven installation directory libexec/conf/settings.xml : <mirror> <id>alimaven</id> <mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf> <name>aliyun maven</name> <url>http://maven.aliyun.com/nexus/content/repositories/central/</url> </mirror> Check whether the value of mirrorOf is configured to * .

Exchange consists of Reader, Processor, and Writer. After Reader reads data from different sources and returns a DataFrame, the Processor iterates through each row of the DataFrame and obtains the corresponding value based on the mapping between fields in the configuration file. After iterating through the number of rows in the specified batch, Writer writes the captured data to the Nebula Graph at once. The following figure illustrates the process by which Exchange completes the data conversion and migration. Editions \u00b6 Exchange has two editions, the Community Edition and the Enterprise Edition. The Community Edition is open source developed on GitHub . The Enterprise Edition supports not only the functions of the Community Edition but also adds additional features. For details, see Comparisons . Scenarios \u00b6 Exchange applies to the following scenarios: Streaming data from Kafka and Pulsar platforms, such as log files, online shopping data, activities of game players, information on social websites, financial transactions or geospatial services, and telemetry data from connected devices or instruments in the data center, are required to be converted into the vertex or edge data of the property graph and import them into the Nebula Graph database. Batch data, such as data from a time period, needs to be read from a relational database (such as MySQL) or a distributed file system (such as HDFS), converted into vertex or edge data for a property graph, and imported into the Nebula Graph database. A large volume of data needs to be generated into SST files that Nebula Graph can recognize and then imported into the Nebula Graph database. The data saved in Nebula Graph needs to be exported. Enterpriseonly Exporting the data saved in Nebula Graph is supported by Exchange Enterprise Edition only. Advantages \u00b6 Exchange has the following advantages: High adaptability: It supports importing data into the Nebula Graph database in a variety of formats or from a variety of sources, making it easy to migrate data. SST import: It supports converting data from different sources into SST files for data import. SSL encryption: It supports establishing the SSL encryption between Exchange and Nebula Graph to ensure data security. Resumable data import: It supports resumable data import to save time and improve data import efficiency. Note Resumable data import is currently supported when migrating Neo4j data only. Asynchronous operation: An insert statement is generated in the source data and sent to the Graph service. Then the insert operation is performed. Great flexibility: It supports importing multiple Tags and Edge types at the same time. Different Tags and Edge types can be from different data sources or in different formats. Statistics: It uses the accumulator in Apache Spark\u2122 to count the number of successful and failed insert operations.

If files are stored locally and Nebula Graph is a cluster architecture, you need to place the files in the same directory locally on each machine in the cluster. Steps \u00b6 Step 1: Create the Schema in Nebula Graph \u00b6 Analyze the data to create a Schema in Nebula Graph by following these steps: Identify the Schema elements. The Schema elements in the Nebula Graph are shown in the following table. Element Name Property Tag player name string, age int Tag team name string Edge Type follow degree int Edge Type serve start_year int, end_year int Create a graph space basketballplayer in the Nebula Graph and create a Schema as shown below. ## Create a graph space. nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer \\ (partition_num = 10, \\ replica_factor = 1, \\ vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30)); ## Use the graph space basketballplayer. nebula> USE basketballplayer; ## Create the Tag player. nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int); ## Create the Tag team. nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string); ## Create the Edge type follow. nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int); ## Create the Edge type serve. nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int); For more information, see Quick start workflow . Step 2: Process CSV files \u00b6 Confirm the following information: Process CSV files to meet Schema requirements. Note Exchange supports uploading CSV files with or without headers. Obtain the CSV file storage path. Step 3: Modify configuration files \u00b6 After Exchange is compiled, copy the conf file target/classes/application.conf to set CSV data source configuration. In this example, the copied file is called csv_application.conf . For details on each configuration item, see Parameters in the configuration file . { # Spark configuration spark: { app: { name: Nebula Exchange 2.6.1 } driver: { cores: 1 maxResultSize: 1G } executor: { memory:1G } cores { max: 16 } } # Nebula Graph configuration nebula: { address:{ # Specify the IP addresses and ports for Graph and Meta services. # If there are multiple addresses, the format is \"ip1:port\",\"ip2:port\",\"ip3:port\". # Addresses are separated by commas. graph:[\"127.0.0.1:9669\"] meta:[\"127.0.0.1:9559\"] } # The account entered must have write permission for the Nebula Graph space. user: root pswd: nebula # Fill in the name of the graph space you want to write data to in the Nebula Graph. space: basketballplayer connection { timeout: 3000 retry: 3 } execution { retry: 3 } error: { max: 32 output: /tmp/errors } rate: { limit: 1024 timeout: 1000 } } # Processing vertexes tags: [ # Set the information about the Tag player. { # Specify the Tag name defined in Nebula Graph. name: player type: { # Specify the data source file format to CSV. source: csv # Specify how to import the data into Nebula Graph: Client or SST. sink: client } # Specify the path to the CSV file. # If the file is stored in HDFS, use double quotation marks to enclose the file path, starting with hdfs://.

Here is the environment configuration information: Hardware specifications: CPU: 1.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 Memory: 16 GB Spark: 2.4.7, stand-alone Hadoop: 2.9.2, pseudo-distributed deployment HBase: 2.2.7 Nebula Graph: master. Deploy Nebula Graph with Docker Compose . Prerequisites \u00b6 Before importing data, you need to confirm the following information: Nebula Graph has been installed and deployed with the following information: IP addresses and ports of Graph and Meta services. The user name and password with write permission to Nebula Graph. Exchange has been compiled , or download the compiled .jar file directly. Spark has been installed. Learn about the Schema created in Nebula Graph, including names and properties of Tags and Edge types, and more. The Hadoop service has been installed and started. Steps \u00b6 Step 1: Create the Schema in Nebula Graph \u00b6 Analyze the data to create a Schema in Nebula Graph by following these steps: Identify the Schema elements. The Schema elements in the Nebula Graph are shown in the following table. Element Name Property Tag player name string, age int Tag team name string Edge Type follow degree int Edge Type serve start_year int, end_year int Create a graph space basketballplayer in the Nebula Graph and create a Schema as shown below. ## Create a graph space. nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer \\ (partition_num = 10, \\ replica_factor = 1, \\ vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30)); ## Use the graph space basketballplayer. nebula> USE basketballplayer; ## Create the Tag player. nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int); ## Create the Tag team. nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string); ## Create the Edge type follow. nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int); ## Create the Edge type serve. nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int); For more information, see Quick start workflow .

Deploy Nebula Graph with Docker Compose . Prerequisites \u00b6 Before importing data, you need to confirm the following information: Nebula Graph has been installed and deployed with the following information: IP addresses and ports of Graph and Meta services. The user name and password with write permission to Nebula Graph. Exchange has been compiled , or download the compiled .jar file directly. Spark has been installed. Learn about the Schema created in Nebula Graph, including names and properties of Tags and Edge types, and more. Hadoop has been installed and started, and the Hive Metastore database (MySQL in this example) has been started. Steps \u00b6 Step 1: Create the Schema in Nebula Graph \u00b6 Analyze the data to create a Schema in Nebula Graph by following these steps: Identify the Schema elements. The Schema elements in the Nebula Graph are shown in the following table. Element Name Property Tag player name string, age int Tag team name string Edge Type follow degree int Edge Type serve start_year int, end_year int Create a graph space basketballplayer in the Nebula Graph and create a Schema as shown below. ## Create a graph space nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer \\ (partition_num = 10, \\ replica_factor = 1, \\ vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30)); ## Use the graph space basketballplayer nebula> USE basketballplayer; ## Create the Tag player nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int); ## Create the Tag team nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string); ## Create the Edge type follow nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int); ## Create the Edge type serve nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int); For more information, see Quick start workflow . Step 2: Use Spark SQL to confirm Hive SQL statements \u00b6 After the Spark-shell environment is started, run the following statements to ensure that Spark can read data in Hive. scala > sql ( \"select playerid, age, name from basketball.player\" ). show scala > sql ( \"select teamid, name from basketball.team\" ). show scala > sql ( \"select src_player, dst_player, degree from basketball.follow\" ). show scala > sql ( \"select playerid, teamid, start_year, end_year from basketball.serve\" ). show The following is the result read from the table basketball.player . +---------+----+-----------------+ | playerid | age | name | +---------+----+-----------------+ | player100 | 42 | Tim Duncan | | player101 | 36 | Tony Parker | | player102 | 33 | LaMarcus Aldridge | | player103 | 32 | Rudy Gay | | player104 | 32 | Marco Belinelli | +---------+----+-----------------+ ...

Environment \u00b6 This example is done on MacOS. Here is the environment configuration information: Hardware specifications: CPU: 1.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 Memory: 16 GB Spark: 2.4.7, stand-alone Hadoop: 2.9.2, pseudo-distributed deployment Nebula Graph: master. Deploy Nebula Graph with Docker Compose . Prerequisites \u00b6 Before importing data, you need to confirm the following information: Nebula Graph has been installed and deployed with the following information: IP addresses and ports of Graph and Meta services. The user name and password with write permission to Nebula Graph. Exchange has been compiled , or download the compiled .jar file directly. Spark has been installed. Learn about the Schema created in Nebula Graph, including names and properties of Tags and Edge types, and more. If files are stored in HDFS, ensure that the Hadoop service is running properly. If files are stored locally and Nebula Graph is a cluster architecture, you need to place the files in the same directory locally on each machine in the cluster. Steps \u00b6 Step 1: Create the Schema in Nebula Graph \u00b6 Analyze the data to create a Schema in Nebula Graph by following these steps: Identify the Schema elements. The Schema elements in the Nebula Graph are shown in the following table. Element Name Property Tag player name string, age int Tag team name string Edge Type follow degree int Edge Type serve start_year int, end_year int Create a graph space basketballplayer in the Nebula Graph and create a Schema as shown below. ## Create a graph space. nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer \\ (partition_num = 10, \\ replica_factor = 1, \\ vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30)); ## Use the graph space basketballplayer. nebula> USE basketballplayer; ## Create the Tag player. nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int); ## Create the Tag team. nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string); ## Create the Edge type follow. nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int); ## Create the Edge type serve. nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int); For more information, see Quick start workflow . Step 2: Process JSON files \u00b6 Confirm the following information: Process JSON files to meet Schema requirements. Obtain the JSON file storage path. Step 3: Modify configuration files \u00b6 After Exchange is compiled, copy the conf file target/classes/application.conf to set JSON data source configuration. In this example, the copied file is called json_application.conf .

Implementation method \u00b6 Exchange uses Neo4j Driver 4.0.1 to read Neo4j data. Before batch export, you need to write Cypher statements that are automatically executed based on labels and relationship types and the number of Spark partitions in the configuration file to improve data export performance. When Exchange reads Neo4j data, it needs to do the following: The Reader in Exchange replaces the statement following the Cypher RETURN statement in the exec part of the configuration file with COUNT(*) , and executes this statement to get the total amount of data, then calculates the starting offset and size of each partition based on the number of Spark partitions. (Optional) If the user has configured the check_point_path directory, Reader reads the files in the directory. In the transferring state, Reader calculates the offset and size that each Spark partition should have. In each Spark partition, the Reader in Exchange adds different SKIP and LIMIT statements to the Cypher statement and calls the Neo4j Driver for parallel execution to distribute data to different Spark partitions. The Reader finally processes the returned data into a DataFrame. At this point, Exchange has finished exporting the Neo4j data. The data is then written in parallel to the Nebula Graph database. The whole process is illustrated below. Data set \u00b6 This topic takes the basketballplayer dataset as an example. Environment \u00b6 This example is done on MacOS.

Element Name Property Tag player name string, age int Tag team name string Edge Type follow degree int Edge Type serve start_year int, end_year int Create a graph space basketballplayer in the Nebula Graph and create a Schema as shown below. ## Create a graph space nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer \\ (partition_num = 10, \\ replica_factor = 1, \\ vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30)); ## Use the graph space basketballplayer nebula> USE basketballplayer; ## Create the Tag player nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int); ## Create the Tag team nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string); ## Create the Edge type follow nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int); ## Create the Edge type serve nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int); For more information, see Quick start workflow . Step 2: Configuring source data \u00b6 To speed up the export of Neo4j data, create indexes for the corresponding properties in the Neo4j database. For more information, refer to the Neo4j manual . Step 3: Modify configuration files \u00b6 After Exchange is compiled, copy the conf file target/classes/application.conf to set Neo4j data source configuration. In this example, the copied file is called neo4j_application.conf . For details on each configuration item, see Parameters in the configuration file . { # Spark configuration spark: { app: { name: Nebula Exchange 2.6.1 } driver: { cores: 1 maxResultSize: 1G } executor: { memory:1G } cores:{ max: 16 } } # Nebula Graph configuration nebula: { address:{ graph:[\"127.0.0.1:9669\"] meta:[\"127.0.0.1:9559\"] } user: root pswd: nebula space: basketballplayer connection { timeout: 3000 retry: 3 } execution { retry: 3 } error: { max: 32 output: /tmp/errors } rate: { limit: 1024 timeout: 1000 } } # Processing vertexes tags: [ # Set the information about the Tag player { name: player type: { source: neo4j sink: client } server: \"bolt://192.168.*.*:7687\" user: neo4j password:neo4j database:neo4j exec: \"match (n:player) return n.id as id, n.age as age, n.name as name\" fields: [age,name] nebula.fields: [age,name] vertex: { field:id } partition: 10 batch: 1000 check_point_path: /tmp/test } # Set the information about the Tag Team { name: team type: { source: neo4j sink: client } server: \"bolt://192.168.*.*:7687\" user: neo4j password:neo4j database:neo4j exec: \"match (n:team) return n.id as id,n.name as name\" fields: [name] nebula.fields: [name] vertex: { field:id } partition: 10 batch: 1000 check_point_path: /tmp/test } ] # Processing edges edges: [ # Set the information about the Edge Type follow { name: follow type: { source: neo4j sink: client } server: \"bolt://192.168.*.*:7687\" user: neo4j password:neo4j database:neo4j exec: \"match (a:player)-[r:follow]->(b:player) return a.id as src, b.id as dst, r.degree as degree order by id(r)\" fields: [degree] nebula.fields: [degree] source: { field: src } target: { field: dst } #ranking: rank partition: 10 batch: 1000 check_point_path: /tmp/test } # Set the information about the Edge Type serve { name: serve type: { source: neo4j sink: client } server: \"bolt://192.168.*.*:7687\" user: neo4j password:neo4j database:neo4j exec: \"match (a:player)-[r:serve]->(b:team) return a.id as src, b.id as dst, r.start_year as start_year, r.end_year as end_year order by id(r)\" fields: [start_year,end_year] nebula.fields: [start_year,end_year] source: { field: src } target: { field: dst } #ranking: rank partition: 10 batch: 1000 check_point_path: /tmp/test } ] } Exec configuration \u00b6 When configuring either the tags.exec or edges.exec parameters, you need to fill in the Cypher query. To prevent loss of data during import, it is strongly recommended to include ORDER BY clause in Cypher queries. Meanwhile, in order to improve data import efficiency, it is better to select indexed properties for ordering. If there is no index, users can also observe the default order and select the appropriate properties for ordering to improve efficiency. If the pattern of the default order cannot be found, users can order them by the ID of the vertex or relationship and set the partition to a small value to reduce the ordering pressure of Neo4j. Note Using the ORDER BY clause lengthens the data import time. Exchange needs to execute different SKIP and LIMIT Cypher statements on different Spark partitions, so SKIP and LIMIT clauses cannot be included in the Cypher statements corresponding to tags.exec and edges.exec . tags.vertex or edges.vertex configuration \u00b6 Nebula Graph uses ID as the unique primary key when creating vertexes and edges, overwriting the data in that primary key if it already exists. So, if a Neo4j property value is given as the Nebula Graph'S ID and the value is duplicated in Neo4j, duplicate IDs will be generated. One and only one of their corresponding data will be stored in the Nebula Graph, and the others will be overwritten. Because the data import process is concurrently writing data to Nebula Graph, the final saved data is not guaranteed to be the latest data in Neo4j. check_point_path configuration \u00b6 If breakpoint transfers are enabled, to avoid data loss, the state of the database should not change between the breakpoint and the transfer. For example, data cannot be added or deleted, and the partition quantity configuration should not be changed. Step 4: Import data into Nebula Graph \u00b6 Run the following command to import Neo4j data into Nebula Graph. For a description of the parameters, see Options for import . ${ SPARK_HOME } /bin/spark-submit --master \"local\" --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange <nebula-exchange-2.6.1.jar_path> -c <neo4j_application.conf_path> Note JAR packages are available in two ways: compiled them yourself , or download the compiled .jar file directly. For example: ${ SPARK_HOME } /bin/spark-submit --master \"local\" --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange /root/nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange/target/nebula-exchange-2.6.1.jar -c /root/nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange/target/classes/neo4j_application.conf You can search for batchSuccess.<tag_name/edge_name> in the command output to check the number of successes. For example, batchSuccess.follow: 300 . Step 5: (optional) Validate data \u00b6 Users can verify that data has been imported by executing a query in the Nebula Graph client (for example, Nebula Graph Studio). For example: GO FROM \"player100\" OVER follow; Users can also run the SHOW STATS command to view statistics. Step 6: (optional) Rebuild indexes in Nebula Graph \u00b6 With the data imported, users can recreate and rebuild indexes in Nebula Graph.

Before batch export, you need to write Cypher statements that are automatically executed based on labels and relationship types and the number of Spark partitions in the configuration file to improve data export performance. When Exchange reads Neo4j data, it needs to do the following: The Reader in Exchange replaces the statement following the Cypher RETURN statement in the exec part of the configuration file with COUNT(*) , and executes this statement to get the total amount of data, then calculates the starting offset and size of each partition based on the number of Spark partitions. (Optional) If the user has configured the check_point_path directory, Reader reads the files in the directory. In the transferring state, Reader calculates the offset and size that each Spark partition should have. In each Spark partition, the Reader in Exchange adds different SKIP and LIMIT statements to the Cypher statement and calls the Neo4j Driver for parallel execution to distribute data to different Spark partitions. The Reader finally processes the returned data into a DataFrame. At this point, Exchange has finished exporting the Neo4j data. The data is then written in parallel to the Nebula Graph database.

The sample data source is a CSV file. Precautions \u00b6 The SST file can be imported only in Linux. The default value of the property is not supported. Background information \u00b6 Exchange supports two data import modes: Import the data from the data source directly into Nebula Graph as nGQL statements. Generate the SST file from the data source, and use Console to import the SST file into Nebula Graph. The following describes the scenarios, implementation methods, prerequisites, and steps for generating an SST file and importing data. Scenarios \u00b6 Suitable for online services, because the generation almost does not affect services (just reads the Schema), and the import speed is fast. Caution Although the import speed is fast, write operations in the corresponding space are blocked during the import period (about 10 seconds). Therefore, you are advised to import data in off-peak hours. Suitable for scenarios with a large amount of data from data sources for its fast import speed. Implementation methods \u00b6 The underlying code in Nebula Graph uses RocksDB as the key-value storage engine. RocksDB is a storage engine based on the hard disk, providing a series of APIs for creating and importing SST files to help quickly import massive data. The SST file is an internal file containing an arbitrarily long set of ordered key-value pairs for efficient storage of large amounts of key-value data. The entire process of generating SST files is mainly done by Exchange Reader, sstProcessor, and sstWriter. The whole data processing steps are as follows: Reader reads data from the data source. sstProcessor generates the SST file from the Nebula Graph's Schema information and uploads it to the HDFS. For details about the format of the SST file, see Data Storage Format . sstWriter opens a file and inserts data. When generating SST files, keys must be written in sequence. After the SST file is generated, RocksDB imports the SST file into Nebula Graph using the IngestExternalFile() method. For example: IngestExternalFileOptions ifo; # Import two SST files Status s = db_->IngestExternalFile({\"/home/usr/file1.sst\", \"/home/usr/file2.sst\"}, ifo); if (!s.ok()) { printf(\"Error while adding file %s and %s, Error %s\\n\", file_path1.c_str(), file_path2.c_str(), s.ToString().c_str()); return 1; } When the IngestExternalFile() method is called, RocksDB copies the file to the data directory by default and blocks the RocksDB write operation. If the key range in the SST file overwrites the Memtable key range, flush the Memtable to the hard disk. After placing the SST file in an optimal location in the LSM tree, assign a global serial number to the file and turn on the write operation. Data set \u00b6 This topic takes the basketballplayer dataset as an example. Environment \u00b6 This example is done on MacOS. Here is the environment configuration information: Hardware specifications: CPU: 1.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 Memory: 16 GB Spark: 2.4.7, stand-alone Hadoop: 2.9.2, pseudo-distributed deployment Nebula Graph: master. Prerequisites \u00b6 Before importing data, you need to confirm the following information: Nebula Graph has been installed and deployed with the following information: IP addresses and ports of Graph and Meta services. The user name and password with write permission to Nebula Graph. --ws_storage_http_port in the Meta service configuration file is the same as --ws_http_port in the Storage service configuration file. For example, 19779 . --ws_meta_http_port in the Graph service configuration file is the same as --ws_http_port in the Meta service configuration file. For example, 19559 . The information about the Schema, including names and properties of Tags and Edge types, and more. Exchange has been compiled , or download the compiled .jar file directly. Spark has been installed. JDK 1.8 or the later version has been installed and the environment variable JAVA_HOME has been configured. The Hadoop service has been installed and started. Note To generate SST files of other data sources, see documents of the corresponding data source and check the prerequisites. To generate SST files only, users do not need to install the Hadoop service on the machine where the Storage service is deployed. To delete the SST file after the ingest (data import) operation, add the configuration -- move_Files =true to the Storage Service configuration file. Steps \u00b6 Step 1: Create the Schema in Nebula Graph \u00b6 Analyze the data to create a Schema in Nebula Graph by following these steps: Identify the Schema elements. The Schema elements in the Nebula Graph are shown in the following table. Element Name Property Tag player name string, age int Tag team name string Edge Type follow degree int Edge Type serve start_year int, end_year int Create a graph space basketballplayer in the Nebula Graph and create a Schema as shown below. ## Create a graph space nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer \\ (partition_num = 10, \\ replica_factor = 1, \\ vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30)); ## Use the graph space basketballplayer nebula> USE basketballplayer; ## Create the Tag player nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int); ## Create the Tag team nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string); ## Create the Edge type follow nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int); ## Create the Edge type serve nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int); For more information, see Quick start workflow . Step 2: Process CSV files \u00b6 Confirm the following information: Process CSV files to meet Schema requirements. Note Exchange supports uploading CSV files with or without headers. Obtain the CSV file storage path. Step 3: Modify configuration files \u00b6 After Exchange is compiled, copy the conf file target/classes/application.conf to set SST data source configuration. In this example, the copied file is called sst_application.conf .

Note that the configuration of spark.sql.shuffle.partition should be added when you submit the command. Note JAR packages are available in two ways: compiled them yourself , or download the compiled .jar file directly. For example: ${ SPARK_HOME } /bin/spark-submit --master \"local\" --conf spark.sql.shuffle.partition = 200 --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange /root/nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange/target/nebula-exchange-2.6.1.jar -c /root/nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange/target/classes/sst_application.conf After the task is complete, you can view the generated SST file in the /sst directory (specified by the nebula.path.remote parameter) on HDFS. Note If you modify the Schema, such as rebuilding the graph space, modifying the Tag, or modifying the Edge type, you need to regenerate the SST file because the SST file verifies the space ID, Tag ID, and Edge ID. Step 5: Import the SST file \u00b6 Note Confirm the following information before importing: Confirm that the Hadoop service has been deployed on all the machines where the Storage service is deployed, and configure HADOOP_HOME and JAVA_HOME . The --ws_storage_http_port in the Meta service configuration file (add it manually if it does not exist) is the same as the --ws_http_port in the Storage service configuration file. For example, both are 19779 . The --ws_meta_http_port in the Graph service configuration file (add it manually if it does not exist) is the same as the --ws_http_port in the Meta service configuration file. For example, both are 19559 . Connect to the Nebula Graph database using the client tool and import the SST file as follows: Run the following command to select the graph space you created earlier. nebula> USE basketballplayer; Run the following command to download the SST file: nebula> DOWNLOAD HDFS \"hdfs://<hadoop_address>:<hadoop_port>/<sst_file_path>\"; For example: nebula> DOWNLOAD HDFS \"hdfs://*.*.*.*:9000/sst\"; Run the following command to import the SST file: nebula> INGEST; Note To download the SST file again, delete the download folder in the space ID in the data/storage/nebula directory in the Nebula Graph installation path, and then download the SST file again. If the space has multiple copies, the download folder needs to be deleted on all machines where the copies are saved. If there is a problem with the import and re-importing is required, re-execute INGEST; . Step 6: (optional) Validate data \u00b6 Users can verify that data has been imported by executing a query in the Nebula Graph client (for example, Nebula Graph Studio). For example: GO FROM \"player100\" OVER follow; Users can also run the SHOW STATS command to view statistics. Step 7: (optional) Rebuild indexes in Nebula Graph \u00b6 With the data imported, users can recreate and rebuild indexes in Nebula Graph.

RocksDB is a storage engine based on the hard disk, providing a series of APIs for creating and importing SST files to help quickly import massive data. The SST file is an internal file containing an arbitrarily long set of ordered key-value pairs for efficient storage of large amounts of key-value data. The entire process of generating SST files is mainly done by Exchange Reader, sstProcessor, and sstWriter. The whole data processing steps are as follows: Reader reads data from the data source. sstProcessor generates the SST file from the Nebula Graph's Schema information and uploads it to the HDFS. For details about the format of the SST file, see Data Storage Format . sstWriter opens a file and inserts data. When generating SST files, keys must be written in sequence. After the SST file is generated, RocksDB imports the SST file into Nebula Graph using the IngestExternalFile() method. For example: IngestExternalFileOptions ifo; # Import two SST files Status s = db_->IngestExternalFile({\"/home/usr/file1.sst\", \"/home/usr/file2.sst\"}, ifo); if (!s.ok()) { printf(\"Error while adding file %s and %s, Error %s\\n\", file_path1.c_str(), file_path2.c_str(), s.ToString().c_str()); return 1; } When the IngestExternalFile() method is called, RocksDB copies the file to the data directory by default and blocks the RocksDB write operation. If the key range in the SST file overwrites the Memtable key range, flush the Memtable to the hard disk. After placing the SST file in an optimal location in the LSM tree, assign a global serial number to the file and turn on the write operation.","title":"Implementation methods"},{"location":"nebula-exchange/use-exchange/ex-ug-import-from-sst/#data_set","text":"This topic takes the basketballplayer dataset as an example.","title":"Data set"},{"location":"nebula-exchange/use-exchange/ex-ug-import-from-sst/#environment","text":"This example is done on MacOS.

The header content has special meanings. Caution If the CSV file contains headers, the Importer will parse the Schema of each row of data according to the headers and ignore the vertex or edge settings in the YAML file. Sample files \u00b6 The following is an example of a CSV file with header: sample of vertex Example data for student_with_header.csv : :VID(string),student.name:string,student.age:int,student.gender:string student100,Monica,16,female student101,Mike,18,male student102,Jane,17,female The first column is the vertex ID, followed by the properties name , age , and gender . sample of edge Example data for follow_with_header.csv : :SRC_VID(string),:DST_VID(string),:RANK,follow.degree:double student100,student101,0,92.5 student101,student100,1,85.6 student101,student102,2,93.2 student100,student102,1,96.2 The first two columns are the start vertex ID and destination vertex ID, respectively. The third column is rank, and the fourth column is property degree . Header format description \u00b6 The header defines the start vertex, the destination vertex, the rank, and some special functions by keywords as follows: :VID (mandatory): Vertex ID.

Importer can read the local CSV file and then import the data into the Nebula Graph database. Scenario \u00b6 Importer is used to import the contents of a local CSV file into the Nebula Graph. Advantage \u00b6 Lightweight and fast: no complex environment can be used, fast data import. Flexible filtering: You can flexibly filter CSV data through configuration files. Release note \u00b6 Release Prerequisites \u00b6 Before using Nebula Importer, make sure: Nebula Graph service has been deployed. There are currently three deployment modes: Deploy Nebula Graph with Docker Compose Install Nebula Graph with RPM or DEB package Install Nebula Graph by compiling the source code Schema is created in Nebula Graph, including space, Tag and Edge type, or set by parameter clientSettings.postStart.commands . Golang environment has been deployed on the machine running the Importer. For details, see Build Go environment . Steps \u00b6 Configure the YAML file and prepare the CSV file to be imported to use the tool to batch write data to Nebula Graph. Download binary package and run \u00b6 Download the binary package directly and add execute permission to it. Start the service. $ ./<binary_package_name> --config <yaml_config_file_path> Source code compile and run \u00b6 Clone repository. $ git clone -b v2.6.0 https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-importer.git Note Use the correct branch. Nebula Graph 1.x and 2.x have different RPC protocols, so: The Nebula Importer V1 branch can only connect to Nebula Graph 1.x. The Nebula Importer Master branch and v2 branch can connect to Nebula Graph 2.x. Access the directory nebula-importer . $ cd nebula-importer Compile the source code. $ make build Start the service. $ ./nebula-importer --config <yaml_config_file_path> Note For details about the YAML configuration file, see configuration file description at the end of topic. No network compilation mode \u00b6 If the server cannot be connected to the Internet, it is recommended to upload the source code and various dependency packages to the corresponding server for compilation on the machine that can be connected to the Internet. The operation steps are as follows: Clone repository. $ git clone -b 2 .6.0 https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-importer.git Use the following command to download and package the dependent source code. $ cd nebula-importer $ go mod vendor $ cd .. && tar -zcvf nebula-importer.tar.gz nebula-importer Upload the compressed package to a server that cannot be connected to the Internet. Unzip and compile. $ tar -zxvf nebula-importer.tar.gz $ cd nebula-importer $ go build -mod vendor cmd/importer.go Run in Docker mode \u00b6 Instead of installing the Go locale locally, you can use Docker to pull the image of the Nebula Importer and mount the local configuration file and CSV data file into the container. The command is as follows: $ docker run --rm -ti \\ --network = host \\ -v <config_file>:<config_file> \\ -v <csv_data_dir>:<csv_data_dir> \\ vesoft/nebula-importer:<version> --config <config_file> <config_file> : The absolute path to the local YAML configuration file. <csv_data_dir> : The absolute path to the local CSV data file. <version> : Nebula Graph 2.x Please fill in 'v2'. Note A relative path is recommended. If you use a local absolute path, check that the path maps to the path in the Docker. Configuration File Description \u00b6 Nebula Importer uses configuration( nebula-importer/examples/v2/example.yaml ) files to describe information about the files to be imported, the Nebula Graph server, and more. You can refer to the example configuration file: Configuration without Header / Configuration with Header . This section describes the fields in the configuration file by category.

Background \u00b6 Nebula Operator automates the management of Nebula Graph clusters, and eliminates the need for you to install, scale, upgrade, and uninstall Nebula Graph clusters, which lightens the burden on managing different application versions. Prerequisites \u00b6 Install software \u00b6 Before installing Nebula Operator, you need to install the following software and ensure the correct version of the software: Software Requirement Kubernetes >= 1.16 Helm >= 3.2.0 CoreDNS >= 1.6.0 CertManager >= 1.2.0 OpenKruise >= 0.8.0 If using a role-based access control policy, you need to enable RBAC (optional). Description of software \u00b6 Note The following software used by Nebula Operator is from the third party. Nebula Operator is not responsible for any problems that may arise during the software installation. CoreDNS CoreDNS is a flexible and scalable DNS server that is installed for Pods in Nebula Graph clusters. Components in a Nebula Graph cluster communicate with each other via DNS resolutions for domain names, like x.default.svc.cluster.local . cert-manager Note If you have set the value of the Nebula Operator configuration item admissionWebhook.create to false , there is no need to install cert-manager. For details about Nebula Operator configuration items, see the Customize Helm charts section in Install Nebula Operator below. cert-manager is a tool that automates the management of certificates. It leverages extensions of the Kubernetes API and uses the Webhook server to provide dynamic access control to cert-manager resources. For more information about installation, see cert-manager installation documentation . cert-manager is used to validate the numeric value of replicas for each component in a Nebula Graph cluster. If you run it in a production environment and care about the high availability of Nebula Graph clusters, it is recommended to set the value of admissionWebhook.create to true before installing cert-manager. OpenKruise OpenKruise is a full set of standard extensions for Kubernetes. It works well with original Kubernetes and provides more powerful and efficient features for managing Pods, sidecar containers, and even container images in clusters. OpenKruise is required to enable advanced features for StatefulSets when Nebula Operator starts. For information about installation, see openkruise installation documentation . Steps \u00b6 Install Nebula Operator \u00b6 Add the Nebula Operator chart repository to Helm. helm repo add nebula-operator https://vesoft-inc.github.io/nebula-operator/charts Update information of available charts locally from chart repositories. helm repo update For more information about helm repo , see Helm Repo . Install Nebula Operator. helm install nebula-operator nebula-operator/nebula-operator --namespace = <namespace_name> --version = ${ chart_version } For example, the command to install Nebula Operator of version 0.9.0 is as follows. helm install nebula-operator nebula-operator/nebula-operator --namespace = nebula-operator-system --version = 0 .9.0 nebula-operator-system is a user-created namespace name. If you have not created this namespace, run kubectl create namespace nebula-operator-system to create one. You can also use a different name. 0.9.0 is the version of the Nebula Operator chart. It can be unspecified when there is only one chart version in the Nebula Operator chart repository. Run helm search repo -l nebula-operator to see chart versions. You can customize the configuration items of the Nebula Operator chart before running the installation command. For more information, see Customize Helm charts below. Customize Helm charts \u00b6 Run helm show values [CHART] [flags] to see configurable options. For example: [ k8s@master ~ ] $ helm show values nebula-operator/nebula-operator image : nebulaOperator : image : vesoft/nebula-operator:v0.9.0 imagePullPolicy : Always kubeRBACProxy : image : gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy:v0.8.0 imagePullPolicy : Always kubeScheduler : image : k8s.gcr.io/kube-scheduler:v1.18.8 imagePullPolicy : Always imagePullSecrets : [] kubernetesClusterDomain : \"\" controllerManager : create : true replicas : 2 env : [] resources : limits : cpu : 200m memory : 200Mi requests : cpu : 100m memory : 100Mi admissionWebhook : create : true scheduler : create : true schedulerName : nebula-scheduler replicas : 2 env : [] resources : limits : cpu : 200m memory : 20Mi requests : cpu : 100m memory : 100Mi Part of the above parameters are described as follows: Parameter Default value Description image.nebulaOperator.image vesoft/nebula-operator:v0.9.0 The image of Nebula Operator, version of which is 0.9.0. image.nebulaOperator.imagePullPolicy IfNotPresent The image pull policy in Kubernetes. imagePullSecrets - The image pull secret in Kubernetes. kubernetesClusterDomain cluster.local The cluster domain. controllerManager.create true Whether to enable the controller-manager component. controllerManager.replicas 2 The numeric value of controller-manager replicas. admissionWebhook.create true Whether to enable Admission Webhook. shceduler.create true Whether to enable Scheduler. shceduler.schedulerName nebula-scheduler The Scheduler name. shceduler.replicas 2 The numeric value of nebula-scheduler replicas. You can run helm install [NAME] [CHART] [flags] to specify chart configurations when installing a chart. For more information, see Customizing the Chart Before Installing . The following example shows how to specify the Nebula Operator's AdmissionWebhook mechanism to be turned off when you install Nebula Operator (AdmissionWebhook is enabled by default): helm install nebula-operator nebula-operator/nebula-operator --namespace = <nebula-operator-system> --set admissionWebhook.create = false For more information about helm install , see Helm Install . Update Nebula Operator \u00b6 After installing Nebula Operator, you can update it by modifying the parameter values in the ${HOME}/nebula-operator/charts/nebula-operator/values.yaml file. Clone the Nebula Operator repository to your local server. git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-operator.git Modify the parameter values in ${HOME}/nebula-operator/charts/nebula-operator/values.yaml . Run the following command to update Nebula Operator. helm upgrade nebula-operator nebula-operator/nebula-operator --namespace = <namespace_name> -f ${ HOME } /nebula-operator/charts/nebula-operator/values.yaml <namespace_name> is a user-created namespace name. Pods related to the nebula-operator repository are in this namespace. Upgrade Nebula Operator \u00b6 Legacy version compatibility Starting from Nebula Operator 0.9.0, logs and data are stored separately. Managing a Nebula Graph 2.5.x cluster with Nebula Operator 0.9.0 or later versions can cause compatibility issues. You can backup the data of the Nebula Graph 2.5.x cluster and then create a 2.6.x cluster with Operator. Update the information of available charts locally from chart repositories. helm repo update Upgrade Operator. helm upgrade nebula-operator nebula-operator/nebula-operator --namespace = <namespace_name> --version = 0 .9.0 For example: helm upgrade nebula-operator nebula-operator/nebula-operator --namespace = nebula-operator-system --version = 0 .9.0 Output: Release \"nebula-operator\" has been upgraded.

Connect to Nebula Graph databases from outside a Nebula Graph cluster via NodePort \u00b6 You can create a Service of type NodePort to connect to Nebula Graph databases from outside a Nebula Graph cluster with a node IP and an exposed node port. You can also use load balancing software provided by cloud providers (such as Azure, AWS, etc.) and set the Service of type LoadBalancer . The Service of type NodePort forwards the front-end requests via the label selector spec.selector to Graphd pods with labels app.kubernetes.io/cluster: <cluster-name> and app.kubernetes.io/component: graphd . Steps: Create a YAML file named graphd-nodeport-service.yaml . The file contents are as follows: apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : labels : app.kubernetes.io/cluster : nebula app.kubernetes.io/component : graphd app.kubernetes.io/managed-by : nebula-operator app.kubernetes.io/name : nebula-graph name : nebula-graphd-svc-nodeport namespace : default spec : externalTrafficPolicy : Local ports : - name : thrift port : 9669 protocol : TCP targetPort : 9669 - name : http port : 19669 protocol : TCP targetPort : 19669 selector : app.kubernetes.io/cluster : nebula app.kubernetes.io/component : graphd app.kubernetes.io/managed-by : nebula-operator app.kubernetes.io/name : nebula-graph type : NodePort Nebula Graph uses port 9669 by default. 19669 is the port of the Graph service in a Nebula Graph cluster. The value of targetPort is the port mapped to the database Pods, which can be customized. Run the following command to create a NodePort Service. kubectl create -f graphd-nodeport-service.yaml Check the port mapped on all of your cluster nodes. kubectl get services Output: NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT ( S ) AGE nebula-graphd-svc ClusterIP 10 .98.213.34 <none> 9669 /TCP,19669/TCP,19670/TCP 23h nebula-graphd-svc-nodeport NodePort 10 .107.153.129 <none> 9669 :32236/TCP,19669:31674/TCP,19670:31057/TCP 24h nebula-metad-headless ClusterIP None <none> 9559 /TCP,19559/TCP,19560/TCP 23h nebula-storaged-headless ClusterIP None <none> 9779 /TCP,19779/TCP,19780/TCP,9778/TCP 23h As you see, the mapped port of Nebula Graph databases on all cluster nodes is 32236 .

Before enabling authentication, you can use any existing username. The default username is root. -p : The password of your Nebula Graph account. Before enabling authentication, you can use any characters as the password. Connect to Nebula Graph databases from outside a Nebula Graph cluster via Ingress \u00b6 Nginx Ingress is an implementation of Kubernetes Ingress. Nginx Ingress watches the Ingress resource of a Kubernetes cluster and generates the Ingress rules into Nginx configurations that enable Nginx to forward 7 layers of traffic. You can use Nginx Ingress to connect to a Nebula Graph cluster from outside the cluster using a combination of the HostNetwork and DaemonSet pattern. As HostNetwork is used, the Nginx Ingress pod cannot be scheduled to the same node. To avoid listening port conflicts, some nodes can be selected and labeled as edge nodes in advance, which are specially used for the Nginx Ingress deployment. Nginx Ingress is then deployed on these nodes in a DaemonSet mode. Ingress does not support TCP or UDP services. For this reason, the nginx-ingress-controller pod uses the flags --tcp-services-configmap and --udp-services-configmap to point to an existing ConfigMap where the key refers to the external port to be used and the value refers to the format of the service to be exposed. The format of the value is <namespace/service_name>:<service_port> . For example, the configurations of the ConfigMap named as tcp-services is as follows: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : tcp-services namespace : nginx-ingress data : # update 9769 : \"default/nebula-graphd-svc:9669\" Steps are as follows. Create a file named nginx-ingress-daemonset-hostnetwork.yaml . Click on nginx-ingress-daemonset-hostnetwork.yaml to view the complete content of the example YAML file. Note The resource objects in the YAML file above use the namespace nginx-ingress . You can run kubectl create namespace nginx-ingress to create this namespace, or you can customize the namespace. Label a node where the DaemonSet named nginx-ingress-controller in the above YAML file (The node used in this example is named worker2 with an IP of 192.168.8.160 ) runs. kubectl label node worker2 nginx-ingress = true Run the following command to enable Nginx Ingress in the cluster you created. kubectl create -f nginx-ingress-daemonset-hostnetwork.yaml Output: configmap/nginx-ingress-controller created configmap/tcp-services created serviceaccount/nginx-ingress created serviceaccount/nginx-ingress-backend created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/nginx-ingress created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/nginx-ingress created role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/nginx-ingress created rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/nginx-ingress created service/nginx-ingress-controller-metrics created service/nginx-ingress-default-backend created service/nginx-ingress-proxy-tcp created daemonset.apps/nginx-ingress-controller created Since the network type that is configured in Nginx Ingress is hostNetwork , after successfully deploying Nginx Ingress, with the IP ( 192.168.8.160 ) of the node where Nginx Ingress is deployed and with the external port ( 9769 ) you define, you can access Nebula Graph. Use the IP address and the port configured in the preceding steps.
