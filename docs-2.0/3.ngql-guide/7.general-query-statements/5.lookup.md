# LOOKUP

The `LOOKUP` statement traverses data based on indexes. You can use `LOOKUP` for the following purposes:

- Search for the specific data based on conditions defined by the `WHERE` clause.

- List vertices with a tag: retrieve the VID of all vertices with a tag.

- List edges with an edge type: retrieve the source vertex IDs, destination vertex IDs, and ranks of all edges with an edge type.

- Count the number of vertices or edges with a tag or an edge type.

## OpenCypher compatibility

This topic applies to native nGQL only.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `LOOKUP` statement, make sure that at least one index is created. If there are already related vertices, edges, or properties before an index is created, the user must [rebuild native index](../14.native-index-statements/4.rebuild-native-index.md) after creating the index to make it valid.

!!! caution

    Correct use of indexes can speed up queries, but indexes can dramatically reduce the write performance. The performance reduction can be as much as 90% or even more. **DO NOT** use indexes in production environments unless you are fully aware of their influences on your service.

## Syntax

```ngql
LOOKUP ON {<vertex_tag> | <edge_type>} [WHERE <expression> [AND <expression> ...]] [YIELD <return_list>];

<return_list>
    <prop_name> [AS <col_alias>] [, <prop_name> [AS <prop_alias>] ...];
```

- `WHERE <expression>`: filters data with specified conditions. Both `AND` and `OR` are supported between different expressions. For more information, see [WHERE](../8.clauses-and-options/where.md).

- `YIELD <return_list>`: specifies the results to be returned and the format of the results.

- If there is a `WHERE` clause but no `YIELD` clause:
  - The Vertex ID is returned when you `LOOKUP` a tag.
  - The source vertex ID, destination vertex ID, and rank of the edge are returned when `LOOKUP` an edge type.

## Limitations of using `WHERE` in `LOOKUP`

The `WHERE` clause in a `LOOKUP` statement does not support the following operations:

- `$-` and `$^`.
- Nested AliasProp expressions in operation expressions and function expressions are not supported.
- Range scan is not supported in the string-type index.
- The `XOR` and `NOT` operations are not supported.

## Retrieve Vertices

The following example returns vertices whose `name` is `Tony Parker` and the tag is `player`.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX index_player ON player(name(30), age);

nebula> REBUILD TAG INDEX index_player;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 15         |
+------------+

nebula> LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.name == "Tony Parker";
============
| VertexID |
============
| 101      |
------------

# The following example uses regex to retrieve vertices.
nebula> LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.name =~ "^.{15,20}$" \
        YIELD player.name, player.age;
+-------------+----------------------+------------+
| VertexID    | player.name          | player.age |
+-------------+----------------------+------------+
| "player147" | "Amar'e Stoudemire"  | 36         |
+-------------+----------------------+------------+
| "player144" | "Shaquille O'Neal"   | 47         |
+-------------+----------------------+------------+
...

nebula> LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.name CONTAINS toLower("L") \
        YIELD player.name, player.age;
+-------------+---------------------+------------+
| VertexID    | player.name         | player.age |
+-------------+---------------------+------------+
| "player145" | "JaVale McGee"      | 31         |
+-------------+---------------------+------------+
| "player144" | "Shaquille O'Neal"  | 47         |
+-------------+---------------------+------------+
| "player102" | "LaMarcus Aldridge" | 33         |
+-------------+---------------------+------------+
...

nebula> LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.name == "Kobe Bryant" YIELD player.name AS name \
        | GO FROM $-.VertexID OVER serve \
        YIELD $-.name, serve.start_year, serve.end_year, $$.team.name;
==================================================================
| $-.name     | serve.start_year | serve.end_year | $$.team.name |
==================================================================
| Kobe Bryant | 1996             | 2016           | Lakers       |
------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Retrieve Edges

The following example returns edges whose `degree` is `90` and the edge type is `follow`.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE EDGE INDEX index_follow ON follow(degree);

nebula> REBUILD EDGE INDEX index_follow;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 62         |
+------------+

nebula> LOOKUP ON follow WHERE follow.degree == 90;
+-------------+-------------+---------+
| SrcVID      | DstVID      | Ranking |
+-------------+-------------+---------+
| "player101" | "player102" | 0       |
+-------------+-------------+---------+
| "player133" | "player114" | 0       |
+-------------+-------------+---------+
| "player133" | "player144" | 0       |
+-------------+-------------+---------+
...

nebula> LOOKUP ON follow WHERE follow.degree == 90 YIELD follow.degree;
+-------------+-------------+---------+---------------+
| SrcVID      | DstVID      | Ranking | follow.degree |
+-------------+-------------+---------+---------------+
| "player101" | "player102" | 0       | 90            |
+-------------+-------------+---------+---------------+
| "player133" | "player114" | 0       | 90            |
+-------------+-------------+---------+---------------+
| "player133" | "player144" | 0       | 90            |
+-------------+-------------+---------+---------------+
...

nebula> LOOKUP ON follow WHERE follow.degree == 60 YIELD follow.degree AS Degree \
        | GO FROM $-.DstVID OVER serve \
        YIELD $-.DstVID, serve.start_year, serve.end_year, $$.team.name;
+-------------+------------------+----------------+--------------+
| $-.DstVID   | serve.start_year | serve.end_year | $$.team.name |
+-------------+------------------+----------------+--------------+
| "player105" | 2010             | 2018           | "Spurs"      |
+-------------+------------------+----------------+--------------+
| "player105" | 2009             | 2010           | "Cavaliers"  |

| "player105" | 2018             | 2019           | "Raptors"    |

## List vertices or edges with a tag or an edge type

To list vertices or edges with a tag or an edge type, at least one index must exist on the tag, the edge type, or its property.

For example, if there is a `player` tag with a `name` property and an `age` property, to retrieve the VID of all vertices tagged with `player`, there has to be an index on the `player` tag itself, the `name` property, or the `age` property.

- The following example shows how to retrieve the VID of all vertices tagged with `player`.

    ```ngql
    nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string,age int);

    nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX player_index on player();

    nebula> REBUILD TAG INDEX player_index;
    +------------+
    | New Job Id |
    +------------+
    | 66         |
    +------------+

    nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name,age) VALUES "player100":("Tim Duncan", 42), "player101":("Tony Parker", 36);
     
    # The following statement retrieves the VID of all vertices with the tag of player. It is similar to MATCH (n:player) RETURN id(n) /*, n */.
    
    nebula> LOOKUP ON player;
    +-------------+
    | _vid        |
    +-------------+
    | "player100" |
    +-------------+
    | "player101" |
    +-------------+
    ```

- The following example shows how to retrieve the source Vertex IDs, destination vertex IDs, and ranks of all edges of the `like` edge type.

    ```ngql
    nebula> CREATE EDGE like(likeness int);

    nebula> CREATE EDGE INDEX like_index on like();

    nebula> REBUILD EDGE INDEX like_index;
    +------------+
    | New Job Id |
    +------------+
    | 88         |
    +------------+

    nebula> INSERT EDGE like(likeness) values "player100"->"player101":(95);

    # The following statement retrieves all edges with the edge type of like. It is similar to MATCH (s)-[e:like]->(d) RETURN id(s), rank(e), id(d) /*, type(e) */.

    nebula)> LOOKUP ON like;
    +-------------+----------+-------------+
    | _src        | _ranking | _dst        |
    +-------------+----------+-------------+
    | "player100" | 0        | "player101" |
    +-------------+----------+-------------+
    ```

## Count the numbers of vertices or edges

The following example shows how to count the number of vertices tagged with `player` and edges of the `like` edge type.

```ngql
nebula> LOOKUP ON player | YIELD COUNT(*) AS Player_Number;
+---------------+
| Player_Number |
+---------------+
| 2             |
+---------------+

nebula> LOOKUP ON like | YIELD COUNT(*) AS Like_Number;
+-------------+
| Like_Number |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
```

!!! note

    You can also use [`show-stats`](./6.show/14.show-stats.md) to count the numbers of vertices or edges.
