# USE

The `USE` statement specifies a graph space as the current working graph space for subsequent queries.

## Prerequisites

Using the `USE` statement to specify a graph space requires some [privileges](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/1.authentication.md). Otherwise, unpredictable results may happen.

## Syntax

```ngql
USE <graph_space_name>;
```

## Examples

```ngql
# The following example specifies space1 as the current working graph space.
nebula> USE space1;

# The following example traverses in space1.
nebula> GO FROM 1 OVER edge1;

# The following example specifies space2 as the current working graph space.
nebula> USE space2;

# The following example traverses in space2. Hereafter, you cannot read any data from space1, because these vertices and edges being traversed have no relevance with space1.
nebula> GO FROM 2 OVER edge2;
```

!!! Caution

    You cannot use two graph spaces in one statement.

    Different from Fabric Cypher, graph spaces in Nebula Graph are fully isolated from each other. Making a graph space as the working graph space prevents you from accessing other spaces. The only way to traverse in a new graph space is to switch by the `USE` statement. In Fabric Cypher, you can use two graph spaces in one statement (using the `USE + CALL` syntax). But in Nebula Graph, you can only use one graph space at a time.
