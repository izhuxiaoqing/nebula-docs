# DROP SPACE

`DROP SPACE` deletes everything in the specified graph space.

## Prerequisites

Only the God role can use the `DROP SPACE` statement. For more information, see [AUTHENTICATION](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/1.authentication.md).

## Syntax

```ngql
DROP SPACE [IF EXISTS] <graph_space_name>;
```

You can use the `IF EXISTS` keywords when dropping spaces. These keywords automatically detect if the related graph space exists. If it exists, it will be deleted. Otherwise, no graph space will be deleted.

The `DROP SPACE` statement does not immediately remove all the files and directories from the disk. You can specify another graph space with the `USE` statement and `submit job compact`.

!!! caution

        **BE CAUTIOUS** about running the `DROP SPACE` statement.
