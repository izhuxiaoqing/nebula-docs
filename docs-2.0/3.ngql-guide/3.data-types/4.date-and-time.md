# Date and time types

This topic will describe the `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`, and `TIMESTAMP` types.

While inserting time-type property values, except for `TIMESTAMP`, Nebula Graph transforms them to a UTC time according to the time zone specified with the `timezone_name` parameter in the [configuration files](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/1.configurations.md). The time-type values returned by nGQL queries are all UTC time.

!!! note

    To change the time zone, modify the `timezone_name` value in the configuration files of all Nebula Graph services.

Combined with `RETURN` clauses, `date()`, `time()`, and `datetime()` all accept empty parameters to return the current date, time and datetime.

## OpenCypher Compatibility

In nGQL:

- Year, month, day, hour, minute, and second are supported, while the millisecond is not supported.

- `localdatetime()` and `duration()` are not supported.

- Most string time formats are not supported. The only exception is `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss`.

## DATE

The `DATE` type is used for values with a date part but no time part. Nebula Graph retrieves and displays `DATE` values in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format. The supported range is `-32768-01-01` to `32767-12-31`.

## TIME

The `TIME` type is used for values with a time part but no date part. Nebula Graph retrieves and displays `TIME` values in `hh:mm:ss.ususus` format. The supported range is `00:00:00.000` to `23:59:59.999`.

## DATETIME

The `DATETIME` type is used for values that contain both date and time parts. Nebula Graph retrieves and displays `DATETIME` values in `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ususus` format. The supported range is `-32768-01-01T00:00:00.000` to `32767-12-31T23:59:59.999`.

## TIMESTAMP

The `TIMESTAMP` data type is used for values that contain both date and time parts. It has a range of `1970-01-01T00:00:01` UTC to `2262-04-11T23:47:16` UTC.

`TIMESTAMP` has the following features:

- Store and display in the form of a timestamp. For example, `1615974839` means `2021-03-17T17:53:59`.

- Supported `TIMESTAMP` query methods: timestamp and `timestamp()` function.

- Supported `TIMESTAMP` inserting methods: `timestamp()` and `now()` functions.

- The underlying storage data type is **int64**.

## Examples

1. Create a tag named `date1` with three properties: `DATE`, `TIME`, and `DATETIME`.

    ```ngql
    nebula> CREATE TAG date1(p1 date, p2 time, p3 datetime);
    ```

2. Insert a vertex named `test1`.

    ```ngql
    nebula> INSERT VERTEX date1(p1, p2, p3) VALUES "test1":(date("2021-03-17"), time("17:53:59"), datetime("2021-03-17T17:53:59"));
    ```

3. Create a tag named `school` with the property of `TIMESTAMP`.

    ```ngql
    nebula> CREATE TAG school(name string , found_time timestamp);
    ```

4. Insert a vertex named `DUT` with a found-time timestamp of `"1988-03-01T08:00:00"`.

    ```ngql
    # Insert as a timestamp. The corresponding timestamp of 1988-03-01T08:00:00 is 573177600, or 573206400 UTC.
    nebula> INSERT VERTEX school(name, found_time) VALUES "DUT":("DUT", 573206400);

    # Insert in the form of date and time.
    nebula> INSERT VERTEX school(name, found_time) VALUES "DUT":("DUT", timestamp("1988-03-01T08:00:00"));
    ```

5. Insert a vertex named `dut` and found time with `now()` function.

    ```ngql
    nebula> INSERT VERTEX school(name, found_time) VALUES "dut":("dut", now());
    ```

You can also use `WITH` statement to set a specific date and time. For example:

```ngql
nebula> WITH time({hour: 12, minute: 31, second: 14}) AS d RETURN d;
+--------------+
| d            |
+--------------+
| 12:31:14.000 |
+--------------+

nebula> WITH date({year: 1984, month: 10, day: 11}) AS x RETURN x + 1;
+------------+
| x          |
+------------+
| 1984-10-12 |
+------------+
```
