# Cloud Solution roles

After creating a Solution, you need to confirm the role privileges in the Cloud platform. This topic introduces the role privileges in the Cloud Solution.

## Built-in roles

Nebula Cloud has multiple built-in roles. The descriptions are as follows:

- OWNER  
  - Correspond to the resource manager who can subscribe services and manage resource privileges.
  - Configure `Solution`, create and confirm services, and activate subscription.
  - Start and stop services of the `Solution`.
  - Authorizing the `ROOT` user in the database manually.
  - Manage the private link of the database and access the database on the Cloud through the private link.
  - View resource logs.
  - Connect to Nebula Dashboard to monitor specified Solution nodes and services.

- ROOT
  - Correspond to the God of the Nebula Graph database, which is set by the OWNER. For privileges of the God role, see [Built-in role privileges](../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md).
  - Manage users with the `USER` role in different spaces in the Cloud platform. When authorizing the `USER` role, you need to specify the role privileges of the Nebula Graph database, including `ADMIN`, `DBA`, `GUEST`, and `USER`. For details, see [Built-in role privileges](../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md).
