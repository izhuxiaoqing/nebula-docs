# Quick start workflow

The quick start introduces the simplest workflow to using Nebula Graph, including deploying Nebula Graph, connecting to Nebula Graph, and doing basic CRUD.

## Documents

Users can quickly deploy and use Nebula Graph in the following steps.

1. [Deploy Nebula Graph with Docker Compose](2.deploy-nebula-graph-with-docker-compose.md)

  There are multiple ways to deploy Nebula Graph, but using Docker Compose is usually considered to be the easiest. The preparations for deployment have been completed in advance, so users only need to follow the instructions in this topic and Nebula Graph will be quickly installed to the local disks. This way to deploy Nebula Graph is only for functional testing. For other ways to deploy Nebula Graph and corresponding preparations, see [deployment and installation](../4.deployment-and-installation/1.resource-preparations.md).

2. [Start Nebula Graph](5.start-stop-service.md)

  Users need to start Nebula Graph after deployment.

3. [Connect to Nebula Graph](3.connect-to-nebula-graph.md)

  Then users can use clients to connect to Nebula Graph. Nebula Graph supports a variety of clients. This topic will describe how to use Nebula Console to connect to Nebula Graph.

4. [CRUD in Nebula Graph](4.nebula-graph-crud.md)

  Users can use nGQL (Nebula Graph Query Language) to run CRUD after connecting to Nebula Graph.
